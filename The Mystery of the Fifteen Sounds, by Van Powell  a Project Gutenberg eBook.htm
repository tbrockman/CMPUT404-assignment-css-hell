<h2 id="c1"><br>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>“<i>No wonder I’m blue,” Roger told his
father, “You’re packing to head a museum expedition
into the heart of Borneo.</i> You’ll <i>have thrills</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Probably I will get my sort of excitement in plenty,
Roger. It won’t be what you are always dreaming
about—the ‘good old days’ of Pirates and Cowboys
and Stage-Coach Bandits.</i>”</p>
<p><i>“No,” Roger agreed, “the real thrills are all gone.
But you can go on an expedition, instead of having
school and</i>——”</p>
<p>“<i>There will be vacation time—baseball</i>——”</p>
<p>“<i>But I want real excitement. I’d like to be a Modern
Pioneer. You are one, going off to Borneo for the
museum just the way Columbus set out for Queen
Isabella.</i>”</p>
<p><i>His father looked up.</i></p>
<p>“<i>You can be a Modern Pioneer. I will show you a
House of Mystery, and once you step into its door you
are in a land where there are more exciting activities
packed into one day than you could get being a combination
cow-hand, bad man, pirate and pony express
rider. You may not be able to convoy an ox-team across
a prairie, carry a squirrel gun and stand off scalping
Sioux; but you will help battle against Pirate Fire,
and Bad Man Erosion, and Bandit Microbe.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>You mean—work in cousin Grover’s research lab?</i>”</p>
<p><i>That was it, he found. And under the brilliant
training of his older cousin, as he came to be the supply
clerk and learned more about the work of the active
place, Roger saw how truly his father had spoken.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p><i>There was fun, and mystery, and excitement, even
in the work. Also, there was the feeling of being a
Modern Pioneer, one who belonged to the band that
had substituted electricity and wings for ox-wagon and
candles, who gave the world instead of the pony rider
carrying news, the radio and radio-telephone. Science
was the Modern Pioneer.</i></p>
<p><i>Where their forefathers sought new borderlands,
these modern way-showers explore the stratosphere.
As their trail-blazing ancestors fought Indians and
hardship and poor crops, these men battle against
disease germs, and soil erosion, and eye-straining light
and every other detriment to safer, happier existence.</i></p>
<p><i>As great as the feat of Columbus, Roger found the
announcement that a cure had been found for a terrible
disease.</i></p>
<p><i>On a par with Daniel Boone’s fame was the renown
of the research worker who extended the range of
compact radio receivers.</i></p>
<p><i>In such privately owned laboratories as that of his
cousin, Grover Brown, and in those associated with
universities and colleges and other institutions, the
work of the Modern Pioneers went on.</i></p>
<p><i>They loved it, found adventure in it, and joy of
achievement.</i></p>
<p><i>Not always was there the sort of mystery usually
read about in detective stories; but when such problems
did come up, Roger realized how the equipment
of scientific research could be a useful aid to the clever
deductive brain in solving the puzzle.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p><i>It is to show how much of adventure and thrill, excitement
and romance can hide behind electrical
transformers and tubes of germs, bags of sodium carbonate
and humming motors that this experience of a
boy in a scientific research laboratory is offered. Perhaps
some boy, who has almost decided that the only
“real” life involves guns and “rackets,” will be shown
how the useful life of the fellow who fights for humanity
and not against it brings more thrill and joy and
contentment than any of the risky, falsely stimulating
adventures that only lead to discredit, sorrow and punishment.</i></p>

<h2 id="c2"><br>Chapter 1
<br>“THEM MOUSES IS EXTRAVERTED!”</h2>
<p>Something was wrong at the laboratory!
Ringing bells, long before dawn, awakened Roger
Brown.</p>
<p>Dazed at first, he became alert as a strange, cold foreboding
made him leap out of bed.</p>
<p>“Just the telephone,” his thirty year old cousin,
head of the laboratory, called from his room beyond
the adjoining bath. Roger, who was already on his
way to the downstairs library of his cousin’s home,
paused.</p>
<p>“No!” Well built and athletic, sharp-eyed, keen
minded, a worthy student under his brilliant scientific
cousin, Roger spoke earnestly, “It wasn’t just the protective
beam system, or just the fire alarm, either.
Grover, it was <i>both</i>!”</p>
<p>“Impossible! Why have they stopped ringing?” Tying
his robe cord, the older cousin followed Roger.
He knew that “Ear Detective’s” reputation for reading
sounds, even if his own incisive reasoning made
him feel that this time Roger had been too drowsy
to live up to his nickname.</p>
<p>Just the same, he followed.</p>
<p>“As long as the beam was broken,” he insisted,
“The bells ought to continue to ring. I think your
fame as a sound interpreter is done.”</p>
<p>Roger did not try to defend himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>“It was probably a wrong number on the telephone.”
Grover was five steps behind his younger
relative, “If you are so sure it was our alarm system,
especially both bells, why aren’t you dressing to rush
to the lab?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting down to be ready when Tip calls.”</p>
<p>Potiphar Potts, nicknamed Tip, was handy man
at the scientific research plant. He slept there. In a
moment Roger expected to have him call up to report
the reason for the alarm.</p>
<p>“You will never hold your reputation now.” Grover
turned at the library door as Roger, inside, stared,
baffled, at the annunciator panel.</p>
<p>The reputation his cousin spoke about had come
when a chemist, sent to them to help the laboratory
develop a new series of dyes for a textile mill, had
begun to “hear things.” Deaf, wearing an Amplivox,
composed of a chest microphone, batteries and an ear
piece, the man had been nearly crazed by a persecuting,
accusing voice picked up, it seemed, by his device.
Roger, by identifying an odd click he got in a
makeshift imitation Amplivox set, gave Grover the
clue through which a revengeful enemy who had
sought to terrify the man had been discovered. As The
Ear Detective, Roger, who was in charge of the laboratory
stock-room, had really been the means of solving
the mystery.</p>
<p>“I know I heard the laboratory bells,” Roger insisted.</p>
<p>“But the lights on our tell-tale are not lit.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. Both the fire alarm bell and the
system that warns us if anybody enters——”</p>
<p>“But Potts has not called up, either. Go back to
bed.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Grover turned to leave the room. Roger, who was
staying with his cousin while his own father headed
an exploring expedition into Borneo for a museum,
knew that his ears had not betrayed him.</p>
<p>His cousin, several years before, had secured capital
with which to start a scientific research laboratory for
the use of small companies unable to maintain equipment
and an expensive staff.</p>
<p>Every form of research, electrical, chemical, industrial,
and in one instance medical, had been successfully
undertaken.</p>
<p>The “lab” prospered, and enjoyed a reputation for
scientific and human thoroughness and dependability.</p>
<p>Priceless secrets, formulae, data and results were
always in the laboratory, and its owner had devised
seemingly perfect methods for safeguarding the secrets
which rivals, or competing firms, might covet. A completed
series of experiments to find a synthetic substitute
for camphor gum, an industrial formula almost
beyond price, was reposing in the safe on this early
morning of Spring.</p>
<p>The safeguards comprised two:</p>
<p>There was a series of light-beams, interconnected
with microphones and tiny speed cameras, at every
possible entrance. Any broken beam, telling of wrongful
entry, set off a laboratory bell in the room where
Potts slept; and it also was wired to ring a bell at the
owner’s home; and on a panel, numbered lights would
show, by the one that glowed, which entrance had
been used.</p>
<p>To protect the laboratory from fire, and warn of its
existence, a bell of a higher tone with a thermostat
connection in the laboratory, in each section, would
give warning; and if the blaze was in the cellar, a green
bulb would glow; if in the main floor, a red bulb, and
for the upper section a blue bulb would be lit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Naturally, Grover felt that his younger cousin had
mistaken the sound that had awakened both.</p>
<p>Roger, still feeling his weird and unexplainable
sense of hidden danger, picked up the telephone.</p>
<p>The laboratory, when he dialed repeatedly and
waited long, did not respond. Tip, trusted, loyal,
paid extra salary because he was counted on not to
leave the mechanical devices to give the sole protection,
should have answered his extension telephone.</p>
<p>“I tell you there is something wrong,” insisted
Roger.</p>
<p>His cousin, partly convinced, taking on some of
Roger’s concern, began to dress.</p>
<p>Just as he came down Roger knotted his tie.</p>
<p>In the car kept handy in the garage, they drove the
several blocks to the two-story building.</p>
<p>Before they got near it, Grover put on speed.</p>
<p>Fire sirens and the scream of the warning signal on
a police car made both cousins wonder what terrible
situation they might face.</p>
<p>Had some one, entering the laboratory, set off the
first alarm as fire broke out? Had Potts, fighting either
fire or intruder, been rendered incapable of responding
to their telephone call?</p>
<p>“Oh, I hope nothing has happened to Tip.”</p>
<p>Roger was very fond of the dull-witted, but dependable
man, almost an Albino with his sandy hair and
light eyes, who loved to use big words whether they
fitted his idea or not, and who helped in the many
mechanical, photographic and other activities involved
in their work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The car, racing forward, turned into the proper
street and they saw fire apparatus gathering in front
of the building. Roger, as the car slowed, leaped out,
crouching and running to avoid being thrown down
by the momentum.</p>
<p>“Don’t break in!” he shouted to firemen, “Our protective
gas will prevent damage—and water would
ruin our electrical things.”</p>
<p>The company captain paused as he saw, behind the
youthful caller, the taller laboratory owner striding
forward.</p>
<p>His men, with a battering ram, delayed.</p>
<p>The helmeted men, some with axes, others with
scaling ladders, hose, or the rubber covers used by the
emergency squad from the Fire Underwriters, paused.</p>
<p>“What-da-ya mean, nothing more won’t burn?”
growled a policeman from the patrol car standing
nearby.</p>
<p>His finger pointed toward the glass panel of the
main door.</p>
<p>Roger, looking in, saw the curious orange glow and
the weirdly bluish-violet splaying out across the office
from the inner spaces.</p>
<p>“Who—what set off the flouroscope and the X-rays?”
he gasped, while Grover reassured the gathered
people.</p>
<p>Unobtrusively setting one foot well to the side on
the top step, so that his toe, pressed forward, found
the small protecting pin, he unlocked the door, careful
to keep the knob turned toward the left, instead
of in the natural hand-turn to the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>That, Roger knew, cut out that particular light-beam
system, so that they could enter without altering
the present status of the tell-tale panel inside that
would reveal where entry had been made, and by
which magnetized plate the marauder would be held
in trying to escape.</p>
<p>They rushed in. His first rush took Roger to the
panel.</p>
<p>Not a bulb glowed! He stared, unable to accept the
story it told—somebody had set off every light-beam-trip!
That put out the lights.</p>
<p>Not one of the row connected-in with the magnetized
plates was lit, either, and yet no living person
should have walked or crept or climbed away through
door, window, coal-chute or other exit without getting
caught. But Roger did not pause. He ran to
Tip’s room.</p>
<p>Tip, tied tightly to a bedpost, his lips taped shut,
his eyes rolling as he sweated in his frantic effort to
escape, saw him.</p>
<p>Roger first took the tape off as gently as haste allowed.</p>
<p>Just as soon as he was able to speak, Tip gasped:</p>
<p>“Tell Grover them mouses ain’t is.”</p>
<p>“Ain’t <i>is?</i>——”</p>
<p>He knew that Potts used queer phrases, trying to
fit big words in, and this might be his way of leading
up to some puzzling declaration.</p>
<p>“What happened? Stop being smart, and tell me!”
ordered Roger.</p>
<p>“If mouses is here, you say they <i>is</i> here?”</p>
<p>“Well?——”</p>
<p>“They ain’t is.”</p>
<p>“Gone?” Roger stared, “The white rats. Gone?”</p>
<p>“They done extraverted.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Roger had to study that out. He knew that the
psychological word was used by analysts of human
minds to indicate people whose outlook on life was
normal, while introverts were shy, timid people who
were afraid of life. “Extraverted” must mean that the
animals had turned outward toward the world—run
away, or escaped.</p>
<p>“But those white rats—Doctor Ryder’s—were in a
cage with a trap door on top, and they’d been inoculated
with cultures of a spinal disease,” cried Roger.
“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“I was up lookin’ at ’em, and somethin’ with a hand
like a ham hit me back of the ears, and when I come
to, tied, them rats was evacuated. I was drug down
here by a ape and tied. An’ there was somethin’ else
I didn’t get a look at, behind the ape.”</p>
<p>Was the man crazed? It worried Roger.</p>
<p>But a call from Grover, upstairs, quickly told him
that Potts had not been talking wildly.</p>
<p>“Roger,” called his cousin, “The white rats’ cage
is empty!”</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br>Chapter 2
<br>A CREEPING THING!</h2>
<p>It took Roger a moment only to realize the
enormous danger that was behind the loss of those
inoculated rats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>When Doctor Ryder had been allotted space in
which to conduct his experiments to see if he could
perfect a cure for a horribly deadly spinal affliction,
he had decided to experiment, first, on animals.</p>
<p>Such experiments had been gotten under way the
night before.</p>
<p>The rats, inoculated, were carriers of the deadly
germs. If some ignorant person had taken them, and
the public was not warned to be careful, anything
might happen!</p>
<p>One of Grover’s constantly repeated axioms about
laboratory work was:</p>
<p>“Do the first thing first!”</p>
<p>All life, the scientific student always had insisted,
was like the chemical compounds they handled. No
matter what the problem might be, no matter how
it looked, it could be analyzed the way compounds
would be analyzed, the elements could be isolated,
and the base—the guide to the whole condition—could
be known. Sodium, a metal, very unstable, combined
with chlorine, a gas, turned into sodium chloride,
and that was a salt—common table salt, in fact. Yet
the restrainer used in photography, a dissolved salt,
was sodium bromide, another gas and the metal, and
to find out what a compound held, one had to separate
all parts by test and find the base or original element.</p>
<p>But first, one must do the first thing—and in this
situation Roger knew that the first thing was to get
busy on the telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>White rats had been inoculated with dangerous
germs. A bite from such an animal was ten times more
terrible than that of a plain rat, poisonous though
that would be. Therefore, if those inoculated animals
were now missing, Grover, up where their cage had
been, would know it already; but the public, exposed
to possible contamination, must be warned.</p>
<p>Roger plugged in the upstairs telephone so that
the policeman could reach his headquarters and start
a widespread search of all cars on the roads, all suspicious
people carrying sacks or other possible packages
or cases that could hide the rats. The Health Department
and news and radio agencies must be asked to
broadcast public warnings. And the owner of the rats,
Doctor Ryder, should be called.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Roger went upstairs, his report
made his cousin nod approvingly. Roger had done all
he could to avert danger if the rats had been taken
ignorantly by some idiot who might let one or more
escape and spread disease germs.</p>
<p>With his story told, Potts was busy doing what
Grover had ordered as one way to secure clues: a
motion picture camera using non-flam film, flashbulbs
of the latest type, tripod for time exposing, and
both wide-angle and micrometric lenses, to give large
views of big spaces or vastly magnified details of
practically invisible things, formed the kit that the
handy man worked with.</p>
<p>Because he had used his wit Grover had no orders
for Roger as the firemen, police and officers departed.</p>
<p>Nothing could be done until Potts developed his
“takes” so they could be run in the laboratory
screening-room.</p>
<p>Grover, in his small, private “thinking den,” would
want to be left to think out and separate all the
mysteries, so that he could get to the heart of the
affair and thus decide what to do about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Alone, wide-awake, with the dawn just beginning
to lighten the skylight in the roof over his stock-room,
Roger stood thinking.</p>
<p>He knew that if the small, partitioned space set
aside for Doctor Ryder had held clues, Grover would
have told him.</p>
<p>The germs supposed to have been injected into
rats the night before could not have produced much
effect that past night. The doctor had not felt that
he had to observe, personally, as he would have done
later.</p>
<p>Instead, automatic “observers” had been set up.</p>
<p>Inside the empty cage, a dictagraph microphone
showed, fixed to the glass inside the cage top. That,
Roger knew, led to a device like the seismograph
which registers earthquake tremors. Its purpose was
to show, by the vibration of a pen across a moving
tape, when the rats developed any unusual excitement
or stress, which was not expected but was provided for
in that way.</p>
<p>A camera of the moving picture type, but set to
snap one take at minute intervals, would check also;
and if the seismograph got to zig-zagging sharply, it
would make contact on one side with a relay, and
throw on the “continuous” mechanism of the marvelous
camera.</p>
<p>To discover by calculating how much of the tape
had been unreeled when something had stopped it,
was easy; and in that way Roger knew the time that
the mechanism had stopped, although he did not dare
fix that as the time the rats had vanished, because the
tape had started at five in the afternoon, and had
unreeled to the point to show that it had stopped at
four in the morning; but the alarm had not sounded
until half an hour or so later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The tape showed excited swerves of the recording
stylus, but not apparently enough to start the continuous
takes, because Grover had left the magazine
as it was until Potts should be ready to develop all
prints at one time.</p>
<p>With his snapshots and time exposures of wide-angles
of windows, doors, floors, air-conditioning intake,
exhaust, cellar openings and floors, and his
micrometric detail close-ups of parts of all these, Potts
went to the dark-room adjoining Roger’s stock-room.
The film he had taken would fill all tanks, so he left
the other till later.</p>
<p>The authorities had been warned; and nothing
more could be done.</p>
<p>Roger, as the sun rose, telephoned for light breakfast
to be sent from a nearby restaurant, taking Potts
his share in the dark-room.</p>
<p>As he ate, Roger tried to bring some sense into the
baffling set of conditions:</p>
<p>The white rats, in their cage, with the observation
apparatus and chart with notations, should have been
recognized by anybody who could see and who could
read, as dangerous to handle, much more to remove.</p>
<p>With the protecting system set, it should have been
impossible to enter, at all, and more impossible to
get out.</p>
<p>Yet the rats had not by any magic been evaporated
into thin air.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Roger mused, why had the fluoroscope
and X-ray machinery been put into operation?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The entire situation seemed to be too bizarre to
be true: more than all the rest, the mad story of Potts
that he had felt a hand as “big as a ham,” hit him
before he had lost his senses!</p>
<p>Nothing fitted anything else.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, arriving, was as much a contrast to
cold, unexcited Grover as could be imagined. He
sputtered his fears for the public, his dismay that this
should have brought discredit on the laboratory that
had been known to safeguard its precious data.</p>
<p>Roger, watching the pudgy, stout little germ experimenter
who excitedly mixed wild theories with
wilder plans of procedure, thought to himself that
if anybody or anything would upset his cousin, the
man’s emotional excitement would be the thing.</p>
<p>Grover was not stirred out of his quiet manner.</p>
<p>The staff began to arrive. They had all seen in
newspapers or had heard by radio the warnings and
the brief story of the lost rats.</p>
<p>Mr. Millman, the electrical engineer, asked immediately
of Dr. Ryder: “Have you any enemies?”</p>
<p>The experimenter thought that he might have
antagonists among the scientists who disagreed with
his theories; but they would not be men who would
endanger the public for so small a revenge as could
come from criticism of his laxness in not watching his
experiment more closely.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellison, the laboratory’s electrical research specialist
who worked with Mr. Millman, agreed; and
so did the bio-chemist, Mr. Zendt; the analytical
chemist, Mr. Hope, and Grover.</p>
<p>They were discussing the many contradictory and
unexplainable points when Potts called, from the
darkroom:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>“Hi, Rog’—come quick!”</p>
<p>As soon as his eyes were accustomed to the dull rosy
glow after he passed the light-trap, Roger saw Tip
clipping non-flam film positives to drying drums.</p>
<p>“What have you got, Tip?”</p>
<p>“Look!”</p>
<p>Potts snapped a strip in place in a vision tunnel:
Roger applied his eye to the lens, and saw, enlarged
on the viewing-plate, what appeared to be the edge
of a cellar step. With side-lighting, magnified ridges
and depressions in dust looked like a range of hills
and vales.</p>
<p>“It was a snake!”</p>
<p>“A—did you say ‘snake’?” Roger gasped, “How do
you get that?”</p>
<p>Potts changed films under Roger’s gaze; an enlarged
wide-angle of several steps was before his eyes,
and the snake-slide of some body that had dragged
across just the step-edges, and had made no track of
hand or foot on the level of the steps showed!</p>
<p>“It certainly looks like something that creeps, Tip.”</p>
<p>“Well, a snake creeps. A snake! What else?”</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br>Chapter 3
<br>A “SOUND” CLUE</h2>
<p>Without waiting for the gelatin to harden,
Roger summoned the staff and his cousin to the screening
room. As soon as they had set their wrist watches
with the observatory time signals, a routine part of the
staff’s accuracy, they joined him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>He had the tender emulsion-covered celluloid
threaded from the top magazine through film gate
and take-up sprockets down to the lower magazine of
the projector. In the small, compact theatre, with its
platform for lecture and demonstration procedure,
its large screen, easy chairs, loud speakers and apparatus,
he showed Grover and the men what caused
him to agree with Tip.</p>
<p>“It almost has to be a snake,” Roger declared.</p>
<p>No other than a creeping thing could drag over
a step edge. Four footed creatures, he explained, did
not disturb dust at the point indicated in close-up and
wide-angle pictures, greatly enlarged by the projector.</p>
<p>The chief electrical specialist, Mr. Ellison, agreed.
“It ends the mystery. A snake ate the rats.”</p>
<p>“Then there won’t be any disease epidemic,”
Doctor Ryder was much relieved, “It will crawl somewhere
and the germs may destroy the reptile.” To
this Mr. Millman, electrical engineer; Mr. Zendt,
bio-chemist; Mr. Hope, their analyst, and others,
agreed.</p>
<p>Roger saw that his cousin reserved opinion. But
routine had to go forward, and the staff men separated.
Zendt went to resume experiments in the search for
a dye of a certain desired shade and quality: the two
electrical men were busy developing means to find
a better way to insulate high-tension cable for carrying
electricity from generators to distributing stations
in small communities; the others had equally absorbing
work in progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Grover, busy examining each picture projected and
held on the screen without danger of the “cold” light
igniting the protected film, gave Roger a dozen cellar
views around the coal-chute to enlarge.</p>
<p>“Make ten-by-twelve bromide enlargement prints,”
he ordered.</p>
<p>Roger, although it seemed impossible that anyone
could have moved the stiff rusted bolt inside the trapdoor
of the coal chute, a trap that lifted up and out
onto the street, said no word of objection.</p>
<p>He felt that Grover would find nothing in the enlargements.</p>
<p>Expertly he adjusted paper on the camera-stand,
extended the bellows to secure most perfect focus,
made his exposures, developed, and fixed the large
prints, and took them to his cousin’s own den.</p>
<p>“As I expected—nothing!” he reported.</p>
<p>“No abrasions of the bolt, or edge of the trap?”</p>
<p>“You mean, where someone inserted a ‘jimmy’ to
shove back the bolt?”</p>
<p>Grover nodded.</p>
<p>“Not a thing shows.” Roger asserted. His cousin
did not accept his statement; but his disappointed
eyes told Roger that the examination he had made
during developing work had been accurate, thorough,
and had led to a correct decision.</p>
<p>They were at a standstill. Calls to the zoo, brought
from its curator the declaration that no snake was
absent from its cage, that no one of his keepers had
tried to “train” snakes—as the laboratory head had
half-laughingly suggested.</p>
<p>As he left the screening room, Roger met Potts.</p>
<p>“Tip,” he hailed, “Did you get anything on the
‘sound’ film in the one-snap-a-minute camera?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>“The one that took pictures of them mouses?”</p>
<p>“The one by the rats’ cage—yes.”</p>
<p>“You know about sound, Rog’. It ain’t just a lot
of single pictures.” Potts wanted to air his knowledge.
“Sound is a maintained concession of peaks an’ valleys
on the sound track.”</p>
<p>“You always will use a .44 caliber word when a
BB. size would hit what you aim at and not blow
your idea to bits, Tip. You mean that sound is a ‘sustained
succession’—I know that. And single frames, if
they showed any sound impression at all, would give
little pops.”</p>
<p>“So I didn’t bother.”</p>
<p>“But, Tip! There was a lot of wild zig-zag marking
on the tape in the seismograph-like recorder; and it
seemed as though the ‘continuous’ taking lever had
been shifted before he—it—whatever was there,
stopped the whole business by breaking off the wiring.”</p>
<p>“We can try.”</p>
<p>When they had developed the negative, made a
print and fixed and washed it, Roger threaded the
fifteen frames of continuous shots in place and projected
with the speakers cut in.</p>
<p>Then he rushed to get Grover. The staff too!</p>
<p>He had a clue.</p>
<p>As nearly as he could have described the brief
sound made and amplified with transformer-coupled,
matched metal audio tubes of the most perfect type
giving the speakers power, they had picked up a sound
of hot grease sputtering, hissing and clicking, as it
does if sausage is fried rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>“Come on, Ear Detective,” chaffed Mr. Millman,
“Who was frizzling sausages on the cage full of inoculated
rats, so that the mike inside picked it up and
took it on to the sound film?”</p>
<p>“That’s not sausage frying,” exclaimed the biochemist,
“Someone had steam up and the mike picked
up the sound the radiator valve made as air was expelled
and steam arrived to close it spasmodically.”</p>
<p>“A microphone, inside of a glass cage top?” mocked
Mr. Ellison. “How could a valve on a radiator across
the room make all that noise?”</p>
<p>“Let the Ear Detective explain it,” urged Mr. Hope.</p>
<p>They all turned to Roger. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“It does sound most like the snick-snap, and sizzle,
of sausage,” he admitted, “But——”</p>
<p>“It’s a snake, I say,” Potts defended his theory; “a
snake, with hissing and his scales rattling on the glass
when he was crawling up to dig his head in and grab
breakfast.”</p>
<p>“What’s your idea, Grover?” asked Mr. Hope.</p>
<p>“Sounds as much like a snake as anything I can
imagine, Sam.”</p>
<p>“So say I,” agreed Mr. Ellison.</p>
<p>“Are we right, interpreter?” Potts got the correct
word, for once.</p>
<p>Roger hesitated. Not that he cared if he lost his
reputation as a young person able to read correctly
what his sensitive ears caught; Roger was not vain or
self-satisfied. He was not the sort to make a statement
just to hold up his reputation.</p>
<p>In some ways the sound might be such as a snake,
with its hide striking or rubbing, as it hissed, could
make; but, again, a lizard might make that sound—or
a dog, scratching on a window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He stood up, excited for the moment.</p>
<p>“<i>Claws on glass!</i>”</p>
<p>His sharp cry died into silence. They all considered
it.</p>
<p>“A snake ain’t got pedicular exuberances,” objected
Potts.</p>
<p>“Pedal protuberances, eh, Tip?” chuckled Mr.
Hope, “What do you say, Grover?”</p>
<p>As Roger looked toward his cousin he saw what
surprised him most of all that had so far happened.</p>
<p>Never in his stay at home or laboratory, intimately
close to the scientifically brilliant, but poised, cousin,
had Roger seen him lose his calm.</p>
<p>Now, Grover stood up, and in his eyes was the same
sort of light of satisfaction and triumph that a boy
would show when he had successfully smuggled in
and hidden mother’s birthday present.</p>
<p>“Roger is absolutely right!”</p>
<p>“Claws on glass? A big dog?” asked Mr. Zendt.</p>
<p>“Remember the cellar step clue.”</p>
<p>“A lizard?” Mr. Ellison suggested.</p>
<p>“Remember Tip’s statement about how he was
knocked senseless.”</p>
<p>“Oh—a man with a—a what?” Mr. Millman was not
so confident of his deductive ability. He paused.</p>
<p>“I will leave you to work it out,” Grover beckoned
to Roger; “I must run out to the zoo.” He was as
eager and elated as a boy with a new football.</p>
<p>He beckoned to Roger who followed as his cousin
got his hat.</p>
<p>“I want you to go to all the newspaper offices. Take
a taxi. Get back issues for the past two weeks, maybe
you’d better get them for three weeks back.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>“You know?——”</p>
<p>“I have two theories. I want to make sure which is
right.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think I got the right meaning out
of the hisses?”</p>
<p>“Precisely the correct meaning.”</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t tell <i>me</i> anything, cousin Grover.”</p>
<p>“Use my formula. Dig past appearances that can
be falsified, to the truth. Marshal your facts, test each
one, eliminate the impossible and what you have left
is the truth.”</p>
<p>Telephoning to summon a taxi for Roger, the
laboratory head was busy for a moment. Roger tried
to employ the method just named.</p>
<p>Youth, inexperience in doing such consecutive and
eliminative thinking, he knew, hampered him. With
a mind trained, through solving chemical, electrical
and other industrial experimental difficulties, Grover’s
clever mind had skipped many of the links that Roger,
slowly, had to take up and examine.</p>
<p>He was in the taxi, with bundles of back issues of
the city papers, on his way back, and still his mind
was a maze of unfitted details.</p>
<p>In the office, combing the papers for notes about
snakes, or any other escaped reptile—he had to keep
in mind that trail on the edge of the steps alone!—he
got nowhere.</p>
<p>No news showed up about lost, stolen or escaped
animals or any form of brute or reptile.</p>
<p>Grover, he saw, had returned, and was not joyful.</p>
<p>“One theory went to smash,” he said, “I verified
your sound—claws on glass was the right deduction.
But—that doesn’t bring what I want.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>“What do you want?” asked Roger, eagerly.</p>
<p>“To capture the culprit.”</p>
<p>“Won’t the police?——”</p>
<p>“We have no justification for calling them in.
Nothing has been stolen. Nothing has been harmed.”</p>
<p>“The rats——the menace to the public!”</p>
<p>“Roger, you haven’t <i>studied</i> those films Potts took.”</p>
<p>Roger got them at once, projected, one at a time,
examining the screen images carefully. The cellar
views, only proving that some object left no other
trace of progress than scraped dust on step-edges, he
considered and discarded.</p>
<p>Those taken by windows, doors, intakes and outlets
of the air-conditioning, and gas-exhausting roof, cellar
and wall orifices gave no revealing clues.</p>
<p>When he got to the wide-angles of the lower floor
and stairway, and found no reward for his long
scrutiny, Roger was baffled.</p>
<p>Only the micrometric enlarged snaps and one time-exposure
near the X-ray devices remained. He considered
them ruefully. They gave no foreground evidence
to help him.</p>
<p>Roger, with defeat creeping over his feelings, was
about to give up.</p>
<p>He was fair, he told himself, when it came to interpreting
sounds, but at the more important quality
of being able to connect the clue with everything
else, he was “stumped.”</p>
<p>What could those enlarged views hide from him?</p>
<p>The walls, with racks of test-tubes, some containing
chemical solutions, others holding cultures of various
forms of growth that Mr. Zendt had accumulated or
was studying, told him——</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He stared, bent closer, climbed up on a chair close
to the screen!</p>
<p>After two minutes of close scrutiny, he jumped to
the floor, and raced to find Grover.</p>
<p>“Just by chance, in taking the micro-lens pictures,”
he gasped out, “Tip got in some of the test-tubes. Is
that what you saw?”</p>
<p>Grover, smiling, agreed. “What did it tell you?”</p>
<p>“I arranged those racks yesterday. I have got a good
memory.”</p>
<p>“I knew both those facts,” Grover admitted, “and
I, too, helped in revising our arrangement of the
racks. Go on!”</p>
<p>“The tubes that held the culture of the spinal
disease germs—so dangerous that they had been delivered,
personally, by the medical center bacteriologist,
had <i>blue</i> labels!”</p>
<p>“You are ‘warm’ as the hide-and-seek game puts it.”</p>
<p>“I saw Doctor Ryder take them up, in his surgeon’s
clothes to prevent infection.”</p>
<p>“So did I.” Grover acknowledged the fact.</p>
<p>“He actually took two tubes that must have had
the right labels because he would have seen what
they were marked.”</p>
<p>“Labels can be soaked off and transposed from one
tube to another, Roger.”</p>
<p>“I think that happened. He took them, went up,
and we both saw him use the hypodermic needle.”</p>
<p>“But—” Roger could hardly restrain his thrill at
having made as clever a discovery as the coming one:</p>
<p>“Those two tubes—full!—are in back of others, right
now. Not the two empty ones he incinerated to be
sure the germs were all destroyed.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>“They are? How did you discover it?”</p>
<p>Roger told him: “Our chemical labels that are a
green, photograph a darkish gray; and our culture
labels, that are a buff, photograph lighter, but still
grayer than white paper. The poisons are labeled red
and come out in a picture almost black.</p>
<p>“<i>But blue except very dark shades, will photograph
nearly white!</i> And those two labels, hidden in a dark
corner, show up in the picture where they might not
be noticed in the rack.”</p>
<p>“Can you go further and say why no culture was
allowed to be given, although the inoculator evidently
thought his serum was genuine?”</p>
<p>“Whoever was going to take the rats, did not want
them to be dangerous to him.”</p>
<p>“Very nicely argued out, Roger,” his cousin complimented
him. “Now, we must find a way to draw
that criminal who trains animals to do his work, into
the open where police can get him.”</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br>Chapter 4
<br>AN ELECTRICAL TRAP</h2>
<p>Startling though Grover’s statement that
a man trained animals to be criminals was, it gave
Roger the one link to build what he knew into a
chain.</p>
<p>Trained animals! That fitted in with claws on glass
and made the rest of the puzzle fall into place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>To Roger, it seemed clear that a clever animal
trainer could teach his beasts to obey criminally intended
orders just as well as make them do the ordinary
tricks.</p>
<p>What animal, he mused, would fit the conditions?</p>
<p>A monkey came to mind as the logical sort.</p>
<p>First of all, it was the one animal able to climb
down a rope from the skylight on the roof, which
it could have reached by being taken up the fire-escape
on a candy factory next door, one story higher
than Grover’s research laboratory.</p>
<p>Coming down in that fashion, it could have been
made to do a trick taught for the purpose—take the
white rats, put them in a sack, and fix it to the rope—or
the sack could already be at the end of the rope.
Then, unaware that it had set off an alarm, it could
have wandered about, doing such tricks as getting
into the light beams, pulling the switch to “on” for
the X-ray and the other electrical devices.</p>
<p>Such an ape, too, with its master joining it during
the time it wandered about, could have invaded
Tip’s room, striking him with a huge paw, because
it would be an ape; no smaller monkey could have
reached down into the rats’ cage.</p>
<p>“How will you trap him?” Roger asked.</p>
<p>When his cousin outlined his plan, Roger was
animated.</p>
<p>“It might work,” he exclaimed, “He will turn out
to be the one who brought the white rats. They were
trained, too, maybe.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>“I wondered that you did not see why I bought
back issues of the newspapers,” Grover told him, “I
had one idea that the thing might have been done
by some zoo keeper; but the more possible notion
was that some vaudeville act had trained animals.
Now we do not need to comb through the advertisements
of the theatre section. We know, by logical deduction,
that we would find it.”</p>
<p>Roger, and Potts, carrying out instructions about
which they said nothing to any member of the staff,
assembled a mass of materials, apparatus and paraphernalia.</p>
<p>There were microphones; and they employed the
laboratory’s device for producing infra-red rays, as
well as a number of small cameras for taking motion
pictures which Potts secured; to each one they applied
a shutter-trip suggested by Grover, that would operate
when a light-beam of the infra-red variety might be
unknowingly broken by an intruder.</p>
<p>Other parts, and wiring by the yard, they connected
up.</p>
<p>“But I don’t understand it,” Potts argued as they
worked. “It’s all right to say a monkey climbed in
through the skylight way; but how does that fit the
snake-trail up the stairway?”</p>
<p>“I asked about that,” Roger told him, “Cousin
Grover was more in a joking humor than I ever saw
him, and he said I’d done so well, he would leave that
for me to work out, too.”</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>“I think so, Tip. How’s this? Monkey comes in.
No alarm on the skylight, because the magnetic plate
under it would be ‘on’ all night and would have
caught anybody—anything but a monkey able to jump
at a command while it swung clear—or the man above
swung it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>“So far, so good.” Potts waited expectantly.</p>
<p>“The ape wandered around, until it heard a call
it recognized from outside, on the street. It was trained
to open bolts, and the only other bolt that wouldn’t
have a camera equipment and electric plate was our
coal chute, that had the Chief stumped how to fix it.”</p>
<p>“And why would he have to go down there?”</p>
<p>“To let in his mate—another beast.”</p>
<p>“And what was it?”</p>
<p>“Well, what could leave a snake trail?”</p>
<p>“A boa-constrictor, or one of them bushmasters out
of Australia?”</p>
<p>“What else—out of Australia?”</p>
<p>Potiphar stared, thinking hard.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Something that hops, and balances with its tail.”</p>
<p>“A—you mean a—kangaroo?”</p>
<p>Roger chuckled, nodding.</p>
<p>“But why did they go to all that trouble, when
a man could of swarmed down a rope, and got the
rats?”</p>
<p>“If he’d got caught—not knowing everything about
the inside of our lab, maybe,” Roger responded,
“He’d go to jail. But if we got a kangaroo, or an ape,
the animal trainer could know it and have an ad.
in next day’s papers, get back his animal that couldn’t
tell what it was there for, and——”</p>
<p>“Well, what <i>was</i> it here for? What made all that
compulsatory?”</p>
<p>“The motive made it compulsory, Tip.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell me about any motive. Or how all
this wire and stuff will catch anything when we don’t
know anything will come tonight, like you hint at.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>“The motive, Cousin Grover thinks, is to get into
our safe, for our data and formula for synthetic
camphor.”</p>
<p>“Well, come to think—one nation practically controls
the camphor gum output, and if they want to
raise the price——”</p>
<p>“Or forbid export to any other country, in war——”</p>
<p>“I can see how much it would be worth to have what
we developed for one client. Maybe some foreign
nation wants the secret.” Tip was alert. His pale
blue eyes and almost albino-white hair made him
seem, usually, washed-out and not very bright. But
with this thrilling possibility of intrigue and excitement
brewing, he was as alert and intelligent as anyone
could be.</p>
<p>“We don’t know. But Cousin Grover thinks he will
draw them on, and he publishes in the evening papers
quite a write-up about the completion of the data.
A friend, a newspaper fellow, will help us get it into
good space.”</p>
<p>“And so the Chief thinks this fellow with the ape
and the mouses and the kangaroo is a criminal and
made them criminals?”</p>
<p>Roger nodded.</p>
<p>They waited until the staff checked up with Grover
all results from the day’s experiments, and departed.
Doctor Ryder, assured that his rats were not a menace,
left with the rest.</p>
<p>Then, carrying from the doors, windows, coal-chute,
skylight and all other available openings, wires
from microphones set there, Roger and Potts led them
all to a three-stage amplifier, having a delicately
diaphragmed headset in circuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>With that headset on, if a heart beat within a foot
of any mike, a drum-beat could be heard in the
headset.</p>
<p>Light-beams criss-crossed the entrances so that they
must be interrupted by anybody or any thing that
came along. Each was in circuit with one lamp of a
number in a shadow-box, and the one that would
stop glowing would show which beam had been
broken.</p>
<p>Thus prepared to be warned well in advance of
any intrusion, Roger sat wearing the headset as he
monitored the volume controls.</p>
<p>Police hid inside and outside of the laboratory.</p>
<p>The safe, bathed in invisible rays, was provided
with a new form of “capacity” protection so that
anybody or anything touching the metal and standing
with feet on the floor, would form a circuit and overload
a sensitive and delicately balanced radio tube,
that would operate a relay, putting into the circuit
a criss-crossed series of small water-hoses, two playing
along each side of a square around the safe, not easily
observed when inactive.</p>
<p>And in that water would be an electric current
strong enough to paralyze and chain, without permanently
harming the invader!</p>
<p>He could not avoid it, because the water must
fall and no one, even aware what would happen,
could dodge or avoid the spray and the stream.</p>
<p>The precious, priceless synthetic camphor secret
was protected.</p>
<p>As he sat, knowing that in the dark around him
were Doctor Ryder, Potts, and his cousin, Roger felt
a little thrill of expectancy and uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Had he foreseen the outcome of the ruse, it is a
question whether he would have danced for joy or
shuddered in terror.</p>
<p>The trap caught something unexpected.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><br>Chapter 5
<br>WHAT ELECTRICITY COULD NOT CATCH</h2>
<p>To Roger, the presence of Doctor Ryder
showed that Grover suspected him. Of the whole staff
only he had been told, included in this vigil.</p>
<p>The headset was shifted slightly away from his ears;
Roger listened, as midnight approached, to his cousin’s
chat with the experimenting medical man.</p>
<p>“Of course I know that I am under suspicion,” Dr.
Ryder said. “The culture was hidden in my section.
Other things look bad——”</p>
<p>“Of the whole staff you are the only man I need <i>not</i>
suspect,” Grover saw deeper into things than had
Roger. “It is an old trick, to turn suspicion toward an
innocent man by ‘planting’ something.”</p>
<p>That, Roger decided, was sounder sense than he had
used. He had forgotten to dig past appearances to the
heart of truth!</p>
<p>“What do you expect will happen here?” asked the
doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>“The miscreant will come, with his menagerie, for
the priceless camphor secret.”</p>
<p>“Pretty smart stuff,” broke in Potts, “coagulating
camphor with kangaroos.”</p>
<p>Coagulating was the wrong word, Roger knew; and
the others saw through the meaning.</p>
<p>“Claws on glass implied something tall enough to
reach up that high on top of the cage,” Grover explained.
“The ‘snake’ trail and an animal with a
dragging tail ‘coagulated.’”</p>
<p>“But why did the man take the white rats?” Potts
was beaming, in the faint glow from the bulbs in the
shadow box; tickled that his word had been so good;
not dreaming that Grover was inwardly amused.</p>
<p>“With the same motive that makes a magician do
meaningless movements with his left hand while he
really palms cards in his other hand,” Dr. Ryder explained,
“to make you look away from the real motive.”</p>
<p>“And he brought the kangaroo and the ape to confusicate
us,” Potts was being clever, he felt.</p>
<p>“I’d say the ape came so he could be used to climb
down a rope, and go and open the cellar trap that had
no beam-alarm,” Roger spoke up. “I looked up notices
in the theatre columns and there is an act that has a
boxing kangaroo, and the critic called it ‘she.’ In the
act, she ‘brings down the house’ when a fire is supposed
to trap the trained rats on the roof of a little house,
and ‘she’ makes everybody laugh by taking the rats
and putting them in the pouch they have to carry their
young in.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, that coagulates,” Potts agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Although all the others realized that the word
meant to clot or curdle, and wanted to smile when it
was used to mean “connects up,” Potts, had they
known it, was precisely correct—for they were to find
that many deductions certainly coagulated, in a broad
way of speaking, the real truth, instead of solving the
mystery.</p>
<p>If clotting and curdling means to thicken and make
lumpy, then as Potts said, Roger’s explanation did
exactly that to their deductive cleverness.</p>
<p>Roger, as the slow minutes dragged along, picked
up with his headset whispers of the policemen outside
a window, exchanging ideas about their tedious
watch; and even the slip and rattle of shifting coal
in the cellar bin.</p>
<p>No invading menagerie, though, brought news to
his intent ears.</p>
<p>A tiny, but sharp click broke a long silence. The
oil-burner relays of heating plants in adjoining buildings
made such “static” on his home radio, he knew,
but the heat would not be used in the hour after
midnight.</p>
<p>None of the apparatus or light was on the laboratory.</p>
<p>The interpretation Roger gave was that in moving
he had jarred some poor connection that made loose
contact in his circuits; and he began testing his wires
at soldered points, seating tubes, and shaking headset
binding posts.</p>
<p>He did not succeed in locating the source of the
single sound, because things began to happen.</p>
<p>From the darkness, and apparently from the upper
floor, in a hollow, grave-yard sort of tone, an unexpected
voice spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Roger, with power full-on, got a roar, and dashed
aside the set to save his ear-drums, for a microphone
had caught and had brought him what the others
heard naturally.</p>
<p>The voice spoke in English, low, deep, mournful
and yet, somehow, menacing, as it said:</p>
<p>“<i>Hear me. I am the Voice of Doom!</i>”</p>
<p>Roger felt his blood “coagulate” in very truth.
Grover, never more calm, although the unforeseen
and uncanny call galvanized and terrified Potts and
made the Doctor’s face look absolutely horrified,
leaped up, and vanished out of the small pool of dull
light from the shadow-boxed panel. With the ease
of familiarity, he got past their great transformers, and
the storage batteries from which direct current was
drawn for certain types of experimentation. He
avoided, in the gloom, the new high-intensity-spark
mechanism, and took the stairs two at a bound.</p>
<p>Roger, impulsively starting to follow, remembered
his duty, and in spite of his shuddering nerves and
the cold fear always coming from any uncanny and
unexplained happening, he stuck to his post.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, attempting to follow, ran into the
recording equipment and stopped, hesitating, as
Grover, from above, threw on the lights. Roger got
the switch-snap, but it differed from his other “click.”</p>
<p>“Nothing here,” Grover called down. “Strange!”</p>
<p>“Potts,” Doctor Ryder turned his head, half accusingly,
“are you a ventriloquist?”</p>
<p>“A——”</p>
<p>“Ventriloquist! Able to throw your voice so that it
sounds as if it came from somewhere else than where
you are.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>“Are you?” asked Roger suddenly.</p>
<p>The other laughed.</p>
<p>Grover, leaving the lights going, came down, switching
on illumination all over the building; while
several policemen came from concealment, blinking
and staring around uncertainly, the experimenter in
the bright light walked over and sat beside Roger.</p>
<p>“Watch me closely,” he half-smiled, but kept his
eyes glancing around half fearfully. “I did not dream—it
would happen—again—and here!”</p>
<p>He spoke as if to himself.</p>
<p>“No, that is not ventriloquism,” he muttered. “It
is some art of the Far East, known to the Lamas of
Tibet——”</p>
<p>Again, and in the same hoarse, menacing, hollow
way, the sound was repeated:</p>
<p>“Hear me! I am the Voice of Doom.”</p>
<p>Potts was shaking with fright. Uncanny and weird,
the sound woke in the rather poorly educated man all
the primitive fears and superstitions of his ancestors.</p>
<p>Grover, listening with his head on one side, his eyes
on the Doctor, spoke:</p>
<p>“He isn’t a ventriloquist, Roger. The changes in
muscular and other throat parts developed by constant
ventriloquial practice, do not show. We took a
film, remember, of just such throat development in
connection with our research for the clue to our case
when the deaf man ‘heard things.’”</p>
<p>Roger, recalling that in that case a tiny click had
also come, when he had listened on a headset, jumped
to the conclusion that he had before found correct.</p>
<p>“Somebody is using Mr. Ellison’s little radio test-sender,”
he declared, confidently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Grover nodded. “Possibly. Go and see.”</p>
<p>“His private locker needs a key that is in the safe.”</p>
<p>“Never mind, then. I think you have the explanation,
Roger.”</p>
<p>Grover sat down again, relieved, as was Potts.</p>
<p>Dr. Ryder, though, seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I must dispute your deduction,” he asserted.
“I have heard that voice before, and it is sent
by some Asiatic, wise in use of the hidden forces of
Nature. It is a manifestation that is directly intended
for me.”</p>
<p>Roger stared at him.</p>
<p>“‘Manifestation’? You mean—like thought transference
or the ‘ghosts’ that spirit-mediums pretend to
call on?”</p>
<p>“Only this is more sinister and terrible, because it
is the way that the Far East makes known to some intended
victim the fact that he is to be punished.”</p>
<p>He rose, and began to pace.</p>
<p>Roger, suddenly intent, caught at a passing
“hunch.”</p>
<p>“Appearances” could be falsified. It appeared to be
fact that something uncanny was happening. Might
it not be the same sort of misleading use of one hand
to distract attention while the other did some trick, as
with the white rats that “appeared” to have been
inoculated, were apparently “stolen” and so on?</p>
<p>Quickly the headset was put on. He cut the output
strength to avoid having his ears blasted if the microphone
upstairs picked up that booming, hollow voice
again.</p>
<p>Grover, intently considering the Doctor’s last
words, spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>“What do you mean by saying that you are being
warned by some occult means that you are marked
to be a victim?”</p>
<p>The man addressed held up a hand.</p>
<p>“It will tell you!” His face was set; he was listening.</p>
<p>Again Roger heard the inexplicable sound.</p>
<p>This time, no voice! Beginning in a low moan, faint
and very much like the whine of a puppy that is
hungry, it grew in volume, and its tone changed from
a high falsetto, running down the scale and then up
again, in cycles, constantly growing louder, while
Grover, again rushing to the upper floor, stood looking
around as, with a great grinding and rumble, following
the last piercing roar of the sound, there fell
silence.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, rising, walked around the recording
machinery and Mr. Ellison’s newest camera, that
worked with a stroboscopic lamp and ran its film so
fast that no shutter was needed, as daylight did not
act on it long enough in any spot to fog it.</p>
<p>“That,” he called upward, “was the real Voice of
Doom.”</p>
<p>Grover, bidding Roger turn over the monitoring
work to Potts, summoned his younger cousin.</p>
<p>“Roger,” as the hurrying figure came into the room
with the vacant glass experiment-cage, “are you afraid
to stay up here?”</p>
<p>“Not much—but if I am, I will stay, just the same.”</p>
<p>“Then set up that sound camera, with film, so you
can take in every foot of this partitioned room. Be
ready, and if the voice comes again, switch on, for
continuous takes.”</p>
<p>“You think—anybody is hiding?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>“No. But a voice means something vibrating. I
could not locate anything. The camera might do so.”</p>
<p>He went down, to give Potts some instructions and
took over the monitor’s post while the handy man
executed his order, which was to mix fresh developers
and fixing baths, and to be ready for whatever Roger
caught.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, helpful and desiring, as he made
plain, to take away Roger’s sense of fear by explaining
how the Far East made so uncanny a manifestation by
mental powers, handed him the can of non-flam negative
so that Roger lost no time in “threading up” and
getting all ready for his duty.</p>
<p>Alert and steady, in spite of his chill of nervous uncertainty
as to what might come next, Roger heard,
seemingly from a corner of the small room, a thump.</p>
<p>“Start it!” gasped the man beside him.</p>
<p>But when two minutes of time had run out the film
in his magazine and nothing more had come, Roger
disappointedly took the film into the dark room and
changed the magazines, hurrying back.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, with nothing to break the
tedium, the next amazing development came. Potts,
in the dark-room, shouted, and tore out into the light,
waving a damp strip of film. He had developed the
film on the chance that the thump had caused some
change.</p>
<p>Instead, developing that film, he had brought, to
wave before Roger’s startled eyes, an impossible thing.</p>
<p>On that film, in a different position on each Frame,
or individual picture, a spectral monkey and an
equally indistinct kangaroo hopped, bounced, and
skipped, finally vanishing into thin air!</p>

<br>A WEIRD STORY</h2>
<p>When that uncanny film was projected before
him Grover seemed unwilling to believe the
testimony of his eyes.</p>
<p>“It simply could not be,” he declared. “That film
was taken from a brand new shipment, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Roger asserted.</p>
<p>“And there were no animals in the laboratory.”</p>
<p>“Not animals we could see,” said Doctor Ryder
meaningly.</p>
<p>Grover, rather sharply, demanded his exact reason
for saying that.</p>
<p>“I have heard the voices that seem to come out of
nowhere,” the experimenter explained. “I have
traveled in the Oriental countries. I have heard
strange things; and I have <i>seen</i> things even more odd.
In India, in China, and all the more in Tibet, there
is what they call the sect of the Bon—Black Magicians.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Grover.</p>
<p>“To a scientific mind—yes. To an ignorant native
of a country without educational facilities or communication
such as our radio, telephone and so on—not
so nonsensical. Besides, I have heard and I have
seen curious things.”</p>
<p>“Like what?” Tip demanded.</p>
<p>“In India, a seed planted and an orange bush growing
before my eyes. Or a rope flung into the air, staying
aloft as if hooked to some invisible support, while
a boy clambers up and seems to vanish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>“In Tibet, as well as in India, men who can apparently
walk on water. Of course, our science explains
it as hypnotism—the man who performs the
feats is able to secure control over some part of the
onlooker’s mind, impress <i>his</i> thoughts on the other
mind, and make one believe the trick is a real occurrence.”</p>
<p>“I have read about men who can walk on pits of
live coals,” Roger added.</p>
<p>“Those tricks or those marvels do not explain this
film,” Grover was not satisfied, Roger knew by his
tone.</p>
<p>“How about telepathy? Thought transference?”</p>
<p>“I believe,” Grover answered, “there is some ground
for accepting that as possible. It might be reasonable
to admit that if a man, by years of practice, can train
himself and also treat his feet so that he can walk on
fiery coals, a man might become able to impress a
powerful idea on another without words. But—on a
film!”</p>
<p>“In the sect of the Bon, or manipulators of the
darker forces of Nature and of man’s superstition
which is half of black magic,” the experimenter declared,
“strange powers exist. I have read of a French
scientist who has succeeded in developing a film so
sensitive that a powerful thought, held by his trained
mind, seemed to cause some changes in the film. This
is a similar situation produced by some Oriental
master mind, probably.”</p>
<p>“Or it could be that things like ghosts are true,”
Potts volunteered. “What do we know about the unseen
things? Even science is finding things like
bacterions——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>“Bacteria,” Grover corrected, smiling.</p>
<p>“—In the air and water and blood. Well—I went to
a spirit-meeting once. The woman threw a fit and
talked awful funny about my ‘deceased aunt on the
other side’ and told me things—now, if we brought
in one of them there test mediators——”</p>
<p>“Test mediums,” Roger knew the right word.
“They pretend to be able to communicate with spirits
of people, but has it been verified?”</p>
<p>Potts was too eager to argue that. He stuck to his
suggestion:</p>
<p>“All right. If we call in a trance medium, she’d tell
us them spooks is around us, right now.”</p>
<p>“Just because the appearance seems to be that,”
Grover stated, “is no basis for accepting the explanation
of telepathy. In that case, Doctor, <i>we</i> would have
seen the objects, the animals. We did not. You and
Roger are sure you saw nothing. There are only two
possible ways the phenomenon could happen.”</p>
<p>“How?” Potts was anxious, eager.</p>
<p>“First: the film had been exposed, previously.
Second: some one hiding in the dark-room, while
Potiphar was not closely observing the developing
tank, changed for the original film in its rubber wrapping,
this one.”</p>
<p>“I used a deep tray, full of pyro,” Potts stated,
“wound the negative around in the rubber, but didn’t
use a tank, on account of them bein’ stained, and you
was so positive about fresh stuff, I got a deep tray,
never used before, and watched every step of developin’.
The second way of it happening is ‘out.’”</p>
<p>“Then we will test the possibility of the first,”
Grover beckoned to Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>“Telephone downstairs for a taxi, and meanwhile,
plug in the telephone in the screening room for me.”</p>
<p>When Roger had summoned a night-hawk car, his
cousin reported his own activity.</p>
<p>“I got the night-watchman at the Bizarre Theatre,
where the animal act finishes its engagement tonight,”
he said. “The white rats and dogs, and several monkeys
are quartered at a pet shop near the theatre.
There is a kangaroo, and it stays in a stable. Here is
the address, Roger. I want you to talk to the keeper,
or some stable attendant who can say when the animal
was taken out and when returned.”</p>
<p>Roger, when the taxi arrived, sped to his task.</p>
<p>He found a sleepy attendant, surprised at the time,
so near dawn, for a visit from a young fellow who
wanted details about the kangaroo.</p>
<p>“She ain’t been out this night,” the youth assured
Roger.</p>
<p>“How about last night? Or the night before?”</p>
<p>“Neither time.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but she must have been.”</p>
<p>“Well, she wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, was the ape?”</p>
<p>“What ape?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t the man who has the trained animals use
an ape?”</p>
<p>“Never saw nor heard of no ape.”</p>
<p>Roger was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Well—” He recalled a flash of inspiration that had
been all his own. He pulled from his pocket the tiny,
compact camera, small magnesium-flash gun, and tripod
folding like a pocket ruler, very slender, but
sturdy when unfurled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>“Can I snap her picture? Our laboratory wants it
to study.”</p>
<p>“Cost you—how much you want to pay?”</p>
<p>“A quarter.”</p>
<p>“Go to it, buddy.”</p>
<p>Roger, with the hand of the youth clutching the
coin, got a good snap just as the flash startled and
almost stampeded the kangaroo and several horses and
a few mules quartered there.</p>
<p>He returned by taxi as the East streaked rosily to
the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>“There was the kangaroo, but she had not been
out—at least, the attendant vowed she hadn’t,” he said.
“But I’ve got her picture to compare with the ghost-one.”</p>
<p>“Clever head,” commended his older cousin. He
went away, pleased, to develop, print and fix his
prize.</p>
<p>While negative and contact print were being fixed
and washed, he sat at the table in the adjoining room
where the mysterious voice and roaring cry had been
located, thinking hard.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” he mused, “if it <i>could</i> be that the film
I used had some sort of emulsion that would be
sensitive to rays we don’t see. You can take a picture
through a quartz lens in a room that seems to be
pitchy black. I’ve done it, with our special equipment.
Maybe a film coating that has some light-sensitive ingredient
sensitive to high-frequency vibrations of
light, could catch what we don’t see, and—who can
dispute this?—there may be in the air, all around us,
forms of things that we can’t see.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Science, he reflected, had managed to develop instruments
so delicately adjusted that they caught earth
tremors and recorded them, when the disturbance
might be hundreds, thousands of miles away from
the seismograph.</p>
<p>Their own Mr. Ellison, the cleverest and best informed
man in the city, on electrical matters, was preparing
a camera that ran its film at high speed past an
aperture: a light more actinic than sunshine alternately
lit and was out, but so rapidly that its flashes
impressed pictures lit by it on the film, as many as a
half million or more a minute, he believed. The
papers had written it up as that many.</p>
<p>And scientific instruments pictured, in graphs, of
course, such invisible things as electrical waves; yes,
and radio made audible the inaudible electrical frequencies
sent by an aerial, caught by another, transformed
into sounds by other invisible agencies.</p>
<p>Grover, when appealed to, nodded.</p>
<p>“Anyone who has operated a modern laboratory
knows better than to make fun of any theory,” he
admitted. “What our Pilgrim ancestors would have
called a witch talking to Satan, we see as an old crone
listening to her radio.”</p>
<p>“They had their witches-on-broomsticks,” Roger
chuckled. “We see airplanes. That’s so.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t pay to scoff at your theory. It may be a
scientific possibility to prove it correct, some day.
But, just yet, let’s not take it as the only explanation
of our ghosts. I realize that the film can was one of
our last shipment, that you had to break the label,
proving it had not been tampered with, apparently.
Still, some test made at the film plant could have been
inadvertently packed. We got it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>“My snap of the kangaroo will prove or disprove
that.” Roger went to get the force-dried bromide enlargement
and the camera film taken in the haunted
room. Comparison showed, apparently, the same
animal, in one case sharply defined, a solid object;
and in the other, just a shadowy specter. They looked
to have the same proportions, though.</p>
<p>“My theory is that someone hired the animal
trainer to send his rats here, so they could be removed.
He could have read notes of the Doctor’s planned
experiment in a science column of the papers.”</p>
<p>“Then where did the ape come from? The attendant
was sure the act did not have any ape in it.” Roger
was still unconvinced.</p>
<p>“That may have been the trainer, an agile man, in a
masquerade costume of Tarzan-type.”</p>
<p>“It might.”</p>
<p>“I will admit that Doctor Ryder tells a story that
makes wilder theories possible,” Grover added. “The
policemen are gone, now. He gave me an outline that
made me discard the theory about danger to our
camphor substitute. Suppose you listen with me to the
full recital.”</p>
<p>The narrative the man spun was amazing.</p>
<p>“Shortly after I left college,” Doctor Ryder began,
“I became interested in study of medicinal herbs, because
an old Indian in up-state New York, who had
earned a reputation as an occult doctor, had made
some astonishing cures of seemingly incurable cases.
A friend and I got into an argument. I supported the
Indian’s claims; and my chum argued it was impossible,
that it was pure medication and not at all due
to magical powers as the people claimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>“I went to the Indian to study,” he went on. “He
took a liking to me, and after a long time, teaching me
secrets of wayside weeds and the properties of common
plants in medication, he confided that in the
Far East there were schools in which full knowledge
of herbal medication could be learned by those
qualified to share the secret—a dangerous one, because
knowledge of it might enable some evil-doer to
procure enough deadly poison among common wayside
flowers and herbs to destroy a city’s populace.”</p>
<p>Skipping his explanations of how he finally secured
the Indian’s help in reaching some one who knew
more, and of how he finally found himself an accepted
student journeying toward a Lamasery in far-away
Tibet, Roger’s next intense interest came with the
declaration:</p>
<p>“I learned something about what Ponce de Leon
spent his time seeking, the secret of eternal youth. I
learned much about marvelous properties of common
plants—and then, through a desire to view with my
own eyes the greatly revered Eye of Om—a precious
jewel set in the forehead of a sacred statue of Buddha—I
became a hunted man, suspected of a theft I
never dreamed of committing, then. The Eye disappeared.
I was suspected. My perils were many. I
finally escaped from the land. But twice, since I began
my private researches, I have been reached by that
strange warning, the Voice of Doom—just as you, who
have been my friends, heard it tonight.”</p>
<p>He bent forward in his chair, earnest, eager.</p>
<p>“I know who took the Eye of Om. If only you
would help me to restore it—if only you <i>could</i>.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br>Chapter 7
<br>SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>When he heard Doctor Ryder’s startling
plea, Roger’s clear, gray eyes lighted with a fire of
hope and excitement.</p>
<p>To be involved in a mystery in the laboratory was
thrilling; but to have a share in restoring the Eye of
Om, evidently a priceless gem, would be more so.</p>
<p>His quick mind flashed over the fascinating prospect;
but with equal quickness he saw the reason why
Grover sat so silent and unimpressed.</p>
<p>A man accused, anxious to return a jewel, would
merit help. A man who knew the real taker of the gem
and wanted it restored meant possible trouble. He
might want them to help him get the gem away from
its possessor.</p>
<p>That was not their duty. It was police work.</p>
<p>“Please be more definite,” Grover said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to help me ‘steal’ the gem from
anybody,” the medical experimenter declared. “I need
financial help to buy it.”</p>
<p>“To buy it,” Roger exclaimed. “That would take
a lot of money. Would the people in Tibet pay you?”</p>
<p>“They would pay a handsome profit, Roger. But it
would not cost such a vast sum as you may think. You
see, the one who has it is not aware of its value.”</p>
<p>“That is curious,” remarked Grover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>“What happened was this: I went to the temple with
a native priest to see the marvel I had heard of. While
we were entering, a figure slipped away out of another
door to the sacred crypt. As we approached the great
figure of Buddha, I saw a vacant hole in it and realized
that the priceless jewel was gone. Terrified at the
thought of being caught, suspected or in some way
associated with the crime against their holiest treasure
and venerated religious symbol, the priest and I hurried
away just as other temple attendants discovered
the situation.”</p>
<p>Without being certain, the rest of the gem’s history
was assumed to be that the thief, terrified, had thrown
away his loot. One of his camp staff, an ignorant,
though strong pack-carrying youth from an American
city, whose way the doctor had paid for his ability to
obey orders without trying to improve on them, had
found the gem, in a fissure of the great mountain pass
they traversed in escaping.</p>
<p>He had evidently taken it to be only a beautiful
native art object and had put it in his pack, apparently,
without mentioning it, meaning to bring it
back to America to “give to his sweetheart,” as the
medical experimenter supposed.</p>
<p>“At any rate,” Doctor Ryder summed up, “he is
living here in the city, his sweetheart had forgotten
him, he has that treasure, put away, and I dare not go
and talk to him about it. I know he has it because he
has shown it, as a souvenir, to people who have recognized
its worth without knowing just what it is. He
would probably sell it for a fairly good sum, if approached
by someone from a museum; but if he was
told its history, and knew its real value, he might sell
it to some gem dealer who would put it beyond my
reach in some private collection. And my life would
be forfeit, because I cannot prove, in the circumstances,
my innocence to the Tibetan Dalai Lama and
his vindictive, fanatical subordinates.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Grover, as Roger watched him eagerly, anxiously,
considered the situation thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I suppose that there are complications,” he said,
finally. “Some international jewel thieves must know
the affair.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” The other man nodded. “That accounts
for the entry, here, night before last. From the use
of a kangaroo I would assume that an Australian is
interested——”</p>
<p>“An ape would mean somebody from Africa,”
Roger argued.</p>
<p>“While the strange projection of the Voice of Doom
implies that the Tibetans are preparing to strike at
me,” Doctor Ryder added.</p>
<p>Grover sat considering the matter.</p>
<p>“With that all granted,” he said, finally, “it is easy
to see what caused the queer ghost-figures in our film.
I assume that the purpose of using the trained boxing
kangaroo with a pouch to carry its young, also trained
to ‘rescue’ from fire, was to furnish a novel way of hiding
and removing the gem which evidently the thieves
think, as do the Tibetans, that you have.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. In your safe.”</p>
<p>“And whoever came,” Roger was able to fill it all in,
now, “with the kangaroo, meant to get into the safe,
get the gem, put it in the animal’s pouch, and then, to
make it go away safely, he had to turn on the fire alarm
that rang a bell, the way it must ring in the act, for
the kangaroo’s signal to rescue the rats. It rescued
them, and hopped away, to its attendant, just the way
it would in the theatre.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>“And what about the film?” asked Doctor Ryder.</p>
<p>“Some was probably in the ‘sound camera’ by the
cage. Either in trying to shut it off or in an accidental
knock against it by the animal, the ‘continuous’ lever
was thrown. Focused with a diaphragm opening to
catch the white rats’ movements under a vivid light,
the lens got only an under-exposure in the light from
the ceiling!”</p>
<p>“Logically,” Grover finished up for his younger
cousin, “the man knew the camera had been running.
He took out that magazine, took the blank film from
the new can to replace it, making as many snaps as
had been made of the rats, jarred the continuous-take
lever on by accident, giving us the clue of claws-on-glass
as his animal came to the cage, with the ringing
of the alarm bell.”</p>
<p>“Science to the rescue!” Roger exclaimed. “Now
we know it must be the animal trainer who is the
key-man. If he did it for his own greed, we can protect
ourselves from him in the future.”</p>
<p>“If he was a hired accomplice of others, as I assume
to be most likely,” Grover added, “he can be compelled
to tell us the facts.”</p>
<p>Declaring that he would interview the man in person,
bidding Roger to add to the few hours of sleep
secured before their midnight watch, the laboratory
head, as the staff began to arrive, urged Doctor Ryder
to say little, and to wait until consideration could be
given to his plea that they help him get the Eye of Om.</p>
<p>On the emergency couch, in a small combination of
rest-and-first-aid room, Roger stretched out without
feeling the least bit drowsy.</p>
<p>The excitement was still keeping him alert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>“Science to the rescue,” he mused. “Modern apparatus
is wonderful and understanding how it works
and what can be done with it ought to help people
solve many mysteries. They have developed instruments
to measure nerve responses and other things.
There is the lie-detector for one device to help fight
crime.</p>
<p>“And if scientific appliances, and scientific understanding,
both can be coupled with Cousin Grover’s
axiom about ignoring appearances and digging to the
heart of truth, analyzing down to the basic element of
a complex combination, it will be even better.”</p>
<p>He thought back along the course of the many happenings,
and of all the clues that scientific apparatus
and wisdom had opened up.</p>
<p>He sat up suddenly.</p>
<p>“Science to the rescue!” he repeated to himself.
“We don’t need to wait to see if the animal trainer
will tell the truth. We can find out right away.”</p>
<p>In the files he found the enlargements made the day
before, from the “routine” wide-angle and close-up
views Potts had taken.</p>
<p>The folder full of pictures, and the rolls of film
from the cabinet he studied carefully.</p>
<p>Roger’s study was concentrated on the close-up and
magnified detail of door locks, window catches and all
openings.</p>
<p>If any catch had been moved the picture should
show to the screen-observing youth, some abrasion, or
some disturbance of rust, or at least a displacement of
the accumulated dust.</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing in any picture, on any film!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>“That tells me that the entry was made through the
skylight, as we had thought,” he decided, but added:</p>
<p>“Or—does it tell more?”</p>
<p>An ape, he felt sure, could not have been trained,
or have sense, to swing so as not to touch a magnetized
and super-charged metal plate concealed by being
painted the same color as the wooden floor under the
skylight.</p>
<p>A man, dressed as an ape, might. But it seemed like
a long way to go around to get through, when a more
simple possibility was open.</p>
<p>Roger assumed that it might be possible that one of
the people interested in securing that priceless treasure
which could be supposed to be in their safe, could
work there!</p>
<p>The fact that no pressure from outside had given its
clue in the pictures, showed him that some “insider”
might have opened the only possible place to get the
kangaroo in—the coal chute.</p>
<p>His examination, with a high-powered, beam-focusing
light and a magnifying lens, revealed that
rust under the bolt had been scraped.</p>
<p>But the pictures had shown no sign of the use of
“jimmy” or other implement for prying back bolts!</p>
<p>An “insider” was responsible for opening that chute
trap.</p>
<p>It would be simple to associate kangaroos with
Australians, apes with Africa, possibly India. It would
be just as easy to narrow it down to whether any of
the staff connected-in with either place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>A man from Australia would naturally think of a
kangaroo and its peculiar qualities and usefulness for
his plan. A man familiar with a country wherein apes
were found might see the usefulness of that animal,
or would resort to a costume for disguise that a man
from the coal counties of Pennsylvania, for instance,
would not have thought of.</p>
<p>To the office files Roger hurried. All the data concerning
each employe, such as age, experience and so
on, was there.</p>
<p>When he had looked, Roger put away the sheets of
data carefully, and waited eagerly for Grover to return
from interviewing the trainer.</p>
<p>Two sheets had told him much. One had given its
maker’s experience on an expedition to India for a
power-plant construction job. There was India, ape
country. Roger knew that in many sections of India,
apes were sacred.</p>
<p>The other sheet had told him that its maker had
worked in Australia under Government chemists,
studying the inroads of a destructive insect.</p>
<p>He had two names to give Grover.</p>
<p>Science, with brains, <i>had</i> come to the rescue.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><br>Chapter 8
<br>BASKETBALL AND BRAINS</h2>
<p>“Admitting your cleverness,” Grover, informed
by Roger, was more than surprised, “I still
find it hard to accept your deductions.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>“I don’t deduce anything,” Roger argued, “I only
got the facts. I think I would almost as soon suspect
you as to suspect Mr. Zendt, or Mr. Ellison. But——”</p>
<p>“The appearances certainly look bad,” Grover
agreed.</p>
<p>Zendt, quiet, calm, thorough, had been in Australia,
his own record attested. Mr. Ellison, than whom
no one was more clever in electrical matters, had built
power plants for a big utility company, some of his
work having been in Calcutta and Karachi, both
Indian cities.</p>
<p>“I will watch them unobtrusively,” Grover stated,
“while you do an errand for me.”</p>
<p>Roger waited for instructions.</p>
<p>“I went to the address given by Doctor Ryder, just
to check up and see if his fantastic story had any basis
of fact,” Grover told his cousin. “Sure enough, there
was dull-witted Toby Smith, and when I represented
myself as an attaché of a museum—I am, you remember,
one of the sub-committee on Egyptian Embalming
research—the young fellow, about twenty-two,
promptly enough produced and let me study the
memento of his adventurous trip into Tibet. He certainly
does not realize its value, and to me, inexperienced
as I am, it appears to be a marvel of Nature’s
crystallizing stresses, as well as a credit to the Tibetan
jeweler’s craftsmanship.”</p>
<p>Roger was all ears.</p>
<p>“To him it was a souvenir, with little other value—a
bit of art-glass, he told me he supposed it was.</p>
<p>“I bought it. You are to go and get it.”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t he let you bring it?”</p>
<p>“I thought of the possibility of being watched——”</p>
<p>Oh, boy! was Roger’s mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>“I satisfied myself that I had not been; however, I
had arranged to have you take him, in return, a small
moving-picture hand-camera that he had confided to
be his heart’s desire. In exchange, he will surrender to
you a large envelope which will contain, disguised in
heavy documentary-looking papers, the art-glass.”
Grover smiled amusedly.</p>
<p>“And if you have any matches or duplicates in your
stamp collection, you might get intimate enough to
trade for some of his foreign over-stock of stamps.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take a batch of duplicates,” agreed Roger.</p>
<p>His taxi, depositing him at the address given by Dr.
Ryder, waited.</p>
<p>The Smith chap, he found, was intensely interested
in collecting, and had a fine collection of stamps; in
fact, he spent most of his small earnings as a dishwasher,
on philatelic prizes.</p>
<p>He and Roger grew intimate and compared notes,
exchanged stamps, and chatted about the Tibetan
expedition Smith had joined as a young man, several
years ago, he claimed.</p>
<p>He told about a Devil Dance, a religious rite, he had
seen, wherein all the devils and evil spirits were represented
by disguised and horrible-looking men, who
chased a wildly terrified human soul, as a boy represented
himself to be in the pantomimic dance. Exhausted,
unable to escape, at last, he was supposed to
be destroyed.</p>
<p>“It is supposed to show how we are chased by temptations
and all,” Toby Smith explained; and he told
of the Tibetan huts and other nomadic possessions of
the ever-moving grazers, and other interesting sights.
Then he gave Roger the heavy, sealed packet—Roger
felt the lump supposed to be the gem. Putting it in his
coat with his stamp envelope, Roger took his leave a
little regretfully. Smith had been an interesting person
to talk with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>However, he concluded, he would, as he had
promised, help with the new and mystifying hobby of
taking “movies.”</p>
<p>The taxi—he had forgotten about it—was gone.</p>
<p>That did not much surprise Roger. The man had
no doubt gone back to the laboratory or had gone on
elsewhere. In the first case they would have told him
they had a charge account with his company; in the
other, knowing it, he would have picked up other
fares and forgotten the young man he had brought
there.</p>
<p>Roger, rather closely confined indoors by his laboratory
work of giving out hypo, sodium bisulphite, or,
perhaps, electrical requisites, decided that the air
would be beneficial. He walked.</p>
<p>It came to him after a few squares that Cousin
Grover had thought of being watched. Roger glanced
around hastily.</p>
<p>He wondered if that slouching fellow with the low-brimmed
hat, could be following him. He whirled in
his tracks, to retrace his way past the other, but the
youth turned in at a cigar store, and Roger, with reassurance
making him whistle gaily, walked on.</p>
<p>Almost at the laboratory street he looked back
again—and was puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The youth was on the trail, possibly, once more.
But he had not kept close; instead he was leaning
against another smoking goods shop window-frame.
Roger, thinking to himself that such espionage could
do no harm, changed his course, and instead of going
directly down to the laboratory street, he turned into
the one behind the laboratory, so that if the youth had
gone into the store to telephone his progress, he would
prevent being met by anyone at the logical corner he
had been heading for. He would approach from the
far end of the block.</p>
<p>To his dismay, this seemed to have been anticipated.
There were about a dozen boisterous, rowdyish young
men and boys racing to and fro in a rough, noisy game
of tag. They might be innocent of any interest in him
and his tight-buttoned coat; but he was taking no
chances. He turned, retracing his way. To his dismay,
one, being chased by the pack, came with long legs
down the street. Roger stopped at a drug store intending
to go in and telephone for Tip; but a woman with
a baby carriage obstructed the entranceway.</p>
<p>He changed his plan quickly. Dodging around her,
he walked rapidly toward the candy factory adjoining
the laboratory. The roughs were passing him. Suddenly
they were all thronging around, pushing, not
caring whether he got into the mixup of thrusting,
hoarse-yelling gamesters or not. Roger felt a little bit
dismayed.</p>
<p>One of the tougher and taller youths caught hold
of his tightly buttoned coat.</p>
<p>“What you buttin’ in our game fer, huh?”</p>
<p>Roger spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>The hold on his coat was too tight to break; they
were behind him as well, and escape was impossible.</p>
<p>“What you got in your coat—candy?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much but a packet of lyddite—the explosive.
Be careful!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>His ruse was not successful. One caught his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What’s that, now lyddite?”</p>
<p>The grip of the other held, and Roger felt the buttons
rip out.</p>
<p>As quick as a flash he had his hands on the packets:
feeling told him which was which. He snatched one
out, and with his eyes fixed over the heads of those he
faced, he shouted:</p>
<p>“Catch it, Tip. Here she comes!” and he made a
move to back out when they would turn to see who he
spoke to. But that ruse also failed and in sudden desperation
Roger realized that he must keep them from
noticing that his coat pocket still held something.</p>
<p>His basket-ball skill, that had enabled him to make
goals by the tosses that seemed impossible with antagonists
all around him, he summoned to help in his
crisis.</p>
<p>He had noticed in the second floor office window,
the work basket some woman had put aside, full of
samples she had brought in from the wrapping machines.</p>
<p>With a deft flexing of muscles and a quick eye-glance
to make sure of distance, wind and other factors,
as hands stretched to snatch his packet, Roger
gave it the well-rehearsed basket-ward toss. He saw it,
as baffled, disconcerted youths looked up, fly in a clean
trajectory to lose momentum just above the basket.
It seemed to hover in the air. It dropped into the
basket. It stayed therein.</p>
<p>As if trying to recover a loss caused by such quick
thinking, the ringleader wheeled and raced into the
building, evidently to ask for the envelope thrown up
by a boy at play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Roger, as the rest hesitated, pushed through, and
hurried for the lab. The others broke and fled.</p>
<p>“Tip,” Roger greeted the handy man as he entered,
“I’m going to phone the people next door to hold an
envelope full of stamps I threw into one of their
baskets to save it from a gang of rowdies. Will you go
and recover it, please? I have to deliver a more precious
pack to my cousin.”</p>
<p>Tip brought back the stamps, quite safe.</p>
<p>And, also quite safe, their strong-box held a
scintillating, vivid, thousand-faceted emerald, flashing
its sun-fires of refracted light; as it had done when
in the forehead of the Buddha it had symbolized, the
all-seeing, all-ways-looking Eye of Om!</p>
<h2 id="c10"><br>Chapter 9
<br>THE VOICE IN THE SILENCE</h2>
<p>“Had your sleep out?” Grover shook his
cousin. “It’s almost eight and Aunt Ella has the
bacon on.”</p>
<p>Roger rubbed his eyes, snapped awake.</p>
<p>“Is it all right at the lab.?”</p>
<p>“I knew it would be. We left Tip to take turns
watching with the men from the Falcon Patrol
Agency. Two at a time, one on each floor. But I never
count on human watchmen alone. They can be careless,”
Grover talked as Roger dressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>“I know. Capacity-overloading plates all around,
so that anybody or anything that got near any apparatus
would overload an aerial field and upset a delicate
tube and open a relay, stamping the time, and starting
cameras with sound-films in them.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Just talked to Potts. Nothing at all
happened.”</p>
<p>Arriving at the laboratory, earlier than the staff,
Roger and the Chief verified the static condition.</p>
<p>“What do you think of this?” Grover took his
cousin to the sound-recording mechanism, the type
that uses a large phonograph record for the sound that
synchronizes with a film in certain motion picture
studios.</p>
<p>He explained that as a double-check on any possible
development, he had hooked up the recorder to a
separate microphone system, all concealed flat-disk,
super-sensitive diaphragm models, that were set in
operation by any interruption of infra-red beams.</p>
<p>“That’s something!” commended Roger, examining
the arrangements, “of course, with the reports in,
I may as well put away the record to keep dust off it
during the day.”</p>
<p>Grover agreed.</p>
<p>Roger moved aside the recorder which had rested
on the outer edge of the disk, just past the polished
edge of the wax.</p>
<p>“Here!” he cried out in surprise, “this isn’t right.
There is a sound-track cut!”</p>
<p>“There can’t be!”</p>
<p>“Well, look, Grover.”</p>
<p>The older cousin stared at the abraded surface, the
cuts in the surface of the composition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>“But that is impossible,” he stared, unbelievingly.</p>
<p>“Let’s give it a playback,” urged Roger. He hurried
to give the surface a good brushing with a soft brush,
exchanged the diamond-pointed recorder for the
type that hooked up with the electrical amplifiers and
speaker in the screening room.</p>
<p>He adjusted the mechanism to run a minute before
lowering the pickup onto the disk, to give him and
his cousin and Tip time to get into their tiny theatre.</p>
<p>The low rasp of the needle as it ran over ungrooved
parts was all they heard, for several breaths.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Out of the speakers, amazing, booming like the
hollow groans that had followed the voices—as they
now did!—came the ghostly salutation and warning:</p>
<p>“Hear me! I am the Voice of Doom.”</p>
<p>Again, while they stared at each other with dilated
eyes, the needle ran with no pickup. Then, again:</p>
<p>“Hear me! I am the Voice of Doom.”</p>
<p>There rose that whining, shrieking moan of the
demented and tortured puppy, lowering in pitch until
it became a hoarse and strident howl, slowly falling
away in volume but dropping in pitch until it sounded
like the moan of wind through stretched silk, ending,
as had ended the original, spooky manifestation upstairs,
in a grinding, abrupt rumble and silence.</p>
<p>Before the staff got there Roger had developed the
sound-films of all the small cameras, but not one had
been impressed with picture or audible sound record.</p>
<p>It was uncanny and inexplicable.</p>
<p>The Falcon men and Potts declared solemnly, and
with sincerity, that they had seen nothing, had heard
nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>This supernatural appearance startled even Grover.
Though he did not depart from his usual calm or drop
his cold poise, he looked more than ever solemn, and
even mistrusted human watchers and his electricity-and-water
protective device so far as to search the safe.</p>
<p>The jewel, as well as the camphor data and other
precious things, to his, and Roger’s, relief, were intact.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, who was given a demonstration of
the spectral recording, looked dismayed.</p>
<p>“If I do not return that stone,” he gasped, “my life
is not worth insuring. This is the third warning, and
conveyed in a way that makes me very certain that
we are dealing with a sinister and very occult body of
priests.”</p>
<p>“How do you propose to return the jewel?” Grover
was practical.</p>
<p>“I dare not let it be known that I have it,” the
medical experimenter declared. “I have thought of
going to Tibet—but how shall I get into that temple,
and how give back the gem? White people will be all
the more forbidden access to the place; and I am already
suspected of having taken the Eye.”</p>
<p>Grover considered it seriously.</p>
<p>Roger, too, gave his best thought to the puzzling
complications.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose they’d have radios in temples in
Tibet,” Roger said, half-hopefully.</p>
<p>“In the Dalai Lama’s palace there is a radio, yes.”</p>
<p>“Short-wave?”</p>
<p>“Probably of the best. We cannot resort to broadcasting,
Roger,” his cousin objected, “the international
gem thieves might pick it up.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>“That’s so——”</p>
<p>“Besides, to ask them to come and take it, as I suppose
you had in mind, would bring every gem hunter,
in disguise or otherwise. And it might lead to worse
consequences than theft. They are fairly desperate,
cold blooded people,” was the doctor’s objection.</p>
<p>Tip, listening, put in a suggestion.</p>
<p>“Let one o’ them that’s been fetchin’ kangaroos and
apes take it. <i>Then</i> radio who’s in the possessive case.
Let <i>them</i> get the Voice of Doom after them.”</p>
<p>Grover smiled, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Tip and I could take it in an airplane,” Roger
hinted eagerly.</p>
<p>“There is only one logical course open,” Grover
gave final decision, “hold everything static. Make no
move. Safeguard Doctor Ryder, with the same type
of protection we have given the safe, in a modified
form. Then, when the promised Doom arrives, its
emissaries can be informed that if they furnish proper
credentials they may have their Eye of Om.”</p>
<p>Tip looked as disappointed as did Roger.</p>
<p>No Tibet? No adventure? No thrills?</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Doctor Ryder shrugged, “it is the sure
way, though not too safe for me, no matter what devices
you arrange. If you knew the hidden forces of
Nature that those Lamas can call into play, modern
scientific protection would be as useful as a child’s
toys to combat unseen dangers that strike through the
air.”</p>
<p>“I will pit my laboratory equipment against any
force you can tell me about,” Grover spoke confidently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>“Well—as one example—how would you guard
against mental suggestions sent by a powerful will,
in my sleep, perhaps causing me to leap out of a
window?”</p>
<p>“I have heard of such powers,” Grover admitted.
“I have never seen them verified. However, for any
occult science I am sure that we can find a material
device to counteract at least the effect on your safety.”</p>
<p>Although Doctor Ryder was skeptical, he shrugged
and submitted.</p>
<p>“I will arrange your room so that nothing can get
in, you cannot creep, crawl, run, jump, push or otherwise
escape,” smiled the scientist. “I shan’t say what
will be set up, and then there can not be any way for
you to frustrate my plan to keep you safe.”</p>
<p>Potiphar, with Roger, heard some quiet instructions.
The sketch and specifications they got made
both of them chuckle.</p>
<p>Any secret schemer, thief, priest of Tibet, or what,
must “go some” to cheat the mass of light-beams,
selenium cells, the recording phonograph, a camera,
and electrified door and window seals that as long as
current held them tight, could open only to Grover’s
own secret key, filed to touch only certain contacts
in a tiny slot on the circuit-cable just outside the
rooms of the doctor.</p>
<p>Tired and full of content after saying good-night
to their protegé, Roger saw the switch set “on” and
went home with Grover to sleep soundly. Nothing
could enter or leave that sealed place!</p>
<p>And to show the fallibility of human wisdom,
Roger waked again in the hour before dawn to hear
Grover answering a wild summons from a Falcon
Patrol Agency guard at the Ryder home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>“Better come,” he was telephoning, “I can’t rouse
him or get him to answer; and from the observation
port I can’t even see him in that room!”</p>
<h2 id="c11"><br>Chapter 10
<br>A DEFEAT FOR SCIENCE!</h2>
<p>Shudders of superstitious fear shook Roger’s
nerves as he flung on his clothes.</p>
<p>Rooms that were locked and barred he had read
about in detective stories; they had been entered. A
room not only so sealed but, far better, sealed by
locks that not even Potts or Roger could have unsealed,
was as impenetrable as a solid block of metal.</p>
<p>Yet some uncanny, mysterious thing, force or
creature had penetrated!</p>
<p>Unless, and he caught at the idea, unless Doctor
Ryder had been worked-up and nervous, and had
dreamed some nightmare that had made him hide.</p>
<p>No matter what had happened, no matter what
force had beaten the scientific measures employed,
they would know the facts, because the registering
devices could not have been stopped by the doctor
himself, let alone any outside person or power. While
that current flowed in the circuits, the devices must
operate; and even if any wires were cut, still the
automatic mechanical springs would run the recorder
and the camera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Driving on speeding wheels, Roger and Grover got
there in quick time. The Falcon man rushed up as
they leaped out of the car.</p>
<p>“Every fifteen minutes,” he reported, “the way you
said, I put my copper key in the slot on the plate over
the observation port you had cut in his room door,
so the plate would move aside as long as I needed to
look to see him in bed. Last time he wasn’t there. Up
to then he’d looked to be sleeping sound.”</p>
<p>They hurried to the room door, on the second
floor, down a hall.</p>
<p>Swiftly, while Roger watched, helping as he could,
Grover took an observation, let Roger see the empty
bed and vacant room. The next move was to test, with
ammeter and test-circuit, every electrical wire that had
been necessarily exposed outside the room.</p>
<p>Not a circuit was broken. Not a wire had been cut.</p>
<p>“Very strange,” even Grover was baffled, “the current
is on, full strength, in each circuit. Try to get
in.”</p>
<p>Roger, at a signal from the Falcon man, worked on
the door locks with the keys that rightfully opened
them; while the man, on a ladder outside a window,
tried to pry open catches or shift the burglar stopper
built into the casing. No success.</p>
<p>“The man may be dying,” the Falcon agent
grumbled, “and we stay out here, testing.”</p>
<p>Roger, too, wondered at such callous but methodically
exact procedure.</p>
<p>Grover, paying no attention to their tell-tale faces,
calmly inserted his key in the secret cable-slot, and cut
out the circuits.</p>
<p>At once Roger was able to turn his door key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>They hurried in.</p>
<p>As he looked around, at the crumpled bed sheets,
at the hollow on the pillow, Roger knew that a man
had slept there. How had he been spirited away?
The closet was wide open, and although clothing had
been flung down, although bureau and chifforobe
drawers had been upset as if in a search for something,
no signs of violence showed.</p>
<p>“Get the record from the phonograph,” Grover had
made swift inspection, “and the camera film. They
operated, of course. You can see the grooved track on
the record. We cannot waste time looking for clues
here. They will come from our spies, the film and record,
at the studio.”</p>
<p>Rapidly they assembled the things needed and drove
to the lab.</p>
<p>With Tip, ready, eager, and quick to help, Roger
got the film into the tank waiting on their arrival, and
set the screening room turntable for the playback. In
no time after their arrival they listened to the revealing
details—and were again baffled.</p>
<p>The record, after running along for a few seconds,
suddenly spoke that weird warning, “The Voice of
Doom!”</p>
<p>As before, it was repeated and was followed by the
uncanny and shrill screech that ran down the scale to
a groan that died in a sudden sharp grinding stop.</p>
<p>“Let it run!” begged Roger as Grover was about
to stop the motor, “maybe he gave us a clue after that
waked him up.”</p>
<p>There was a scraping of the recording needle running
without vibration over the disk for a few seconds,
and then they heard, very faintly recorded:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>“<i>You</i>—Clark!——”</p>
<p>“Who’s Clark, Cousin Gro——”</p>
<p>“Sh-h-h!”</p>
<p>The recording was again audible:</p>
<p>“How did you get in? What do you want?”</p>
<p>A few instants of silence. How could the answer
fail to be recorded? Roger thought swiftly that a
whisper should have left a faint report of its existence.</p>
<p>“It isn’t here.... Look, then....
What do <i>you</i> know about any laboratory?... I don’t
know the combination to any safe!... Yes, let’s go
there. I will be very glad to go with you, Clark! The
great Joseph Z. Clark——”</p>
<p>Only Doctor Ryder’s very easily identified voice
gave the responses and although Roger cut in more
output power and added a stage of transformer-coupled
audio, the speakers gave no intermediate
words.</p>
<p>They were easily guessed at, of course.</p>
<p>Potts, bringing the film, still sopping, groaned.</p>
<p>“Not a thing on it. Wasn’t even exposed.”</p>
<p>Grover and Roger looked.</p>
<p>When light acts on a silver-bromide emulsion, it
develops dark grains of silver where light has fallen,
leaving the shadows unaffected within the degree
that they lack light, thus giving the shadings that become
a picture in the positive print.</p>
<p>All over, and for its whole length, the film that had
run fully three minutes showed as clear of developed
silver as if it had not run through the machine as
evidence proved that it had done.</p>
<p>“A card over the lens,” Grover grunted. “Of
course! This Joseph Z. Clark is a clever man.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>“And so is Doctor Ryder, for he must have guessed
that the recording was going ahead, and he told us
all he could.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Roger. And they haven’t been here yet.”</p>
<p>“So they will walk into a trap,” finished Tip.</p>
<p>They made hurried preparations, hiding the Falcon
guards and finding concealment for themselves.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder had said he would “gladly” bring the
man. How wise! He would know that they would get
him, there.</p>
<p>They did not have a long vigil.</p>
<p>In the tell-tale shadow-box panel of lights wired for
all entrances, the one to the cellar coal chute died
out.</p>
<p>Roger felt his nerves quiver, his muscles grow taut.</p>
<p>All they had to do was to wait.</p>
<p>When the pair got in, came up the stairs, walked
over to the safe, the infra-red beam would break,
tripping relays that set off small water-streams that
would go all ways around the safe, charged with a current
that could chain a marauder in his tracks. Doctor
Ryder, knowing about it, would stay out of range,
sending his captor, the miscreant they wanted, to his
defeat.</p>
<p>They crouched, Roger behind the recording device,
Grover in the office, Tip near the stairs to the
upper floor, the Falcon guards at three strategic points
near ground-floor windows.</p>
<p>There was the silence of a deserted building as
they waited.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. The intruding thief was careful,
Roger decided.</p>
<p>Still more time passed draggily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Roger began to grow cramped, and also very uneasy
in his mind.</p>
<p>What was going on? Was it so wise to wait? Why
not throw on some light. Better sidle over and ask
Grover? No. Better wait.</p>
<p>He strained his ears.</p>
<p>He heard only what seemed to be the drip of a
faucet in the chemical washing-sinks. Tick! Tick-et-y—tick.
Silence. Tick! Tic-tic—tick-y. A wait. Tick-tick.</p>
<p>He tried to focus his hearing on any other possible
sound. The drip-drip effect seemed to cease. He
wondered about it, but decided that it had not been
a faucet but had been a few drops of collected water
running down the drain and striking in the trap.</p>
<p>But as he wondered about it, he began to feel that it
had been a metallic sound, not so much a soft drip.</p>
<p>Risking censure, in his growing uneasiness, he
leaped to his feet and threw into circuit his small
pocket flash. Its beam stabbed the darkness, here,
there.</p>
<p>He shouted in dismay and horror.</p>
<p>The safe door, caught in a flick of the beam, stood
wide open!</p>
<p>Tip threw a wall switch. No light came.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the lights leaped on, water flowed
from the hose.</p>
<p>Too late!</p>
<p>Science had been cheated of its guarded treasure!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br>Chapter 11
<br>A PUZZLING THUMP</h2>
<p>While Tip was rushed out to the street, to
drive Grover’s car to and fro, and all around, in pursuit
of the elusive, uncanny pair—or had the man left
Doctor Ryder elsewhere?—Roger made the routine
photographic study of every place that could give a
clue to that almost spectral arrival, manipulation of a
safe, and retreat.</p>
<p>If only, Roger thought, as he made wide-angle and
micro-lens exposures, if only Tip, excited, had not
fumbled that switch!</p>
<p>Had he gotten the lights on a few seconds sooner,
they might have seen what was going on, or could have
seen the departing figure. If someone had been set to
watch down cellar! If——!</p>
<p>No use bewailing the past. No use wishing the
past could be altered. Doctor Ryder was evidently a
prisoner. His gem—the Tibetan jewel, was gone. The
Voice of Doom had spoken, but it had apparently
turned out to be some person known to the doctor,
whom he had recognized, and had identified for them.</p>
<p>Tip came dashing back. The car had been taken.
Later a policeman returned the abandoned vehicle,
and Tip had more photographs to make of its wheel,
door-grips, seats, pedals.</p>
<p>Tracks in the soft smeared stuff with which Grover
had made such clues possible, they found in plenty
from coal pile upstairs and straight to the safe, and,
less defined, returning cellarward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Only one set! Great, over-size tracks. Defeat again,
as Roger realized. Someone had worn huge boots!
The shoe-size was unguessable from those elephantine
clues.</p>
<p>Gloves, as well as boots, left them no usable evidences.</p>
<p>Roger, turning over to Tip the final stages of his
work, went to Grover, who sat in the screening room,
as dawn broke, and brooded. It seemed to Roger that
his clever cousin, so often hoodwinked and made cheap
by some seemingly more astute operator, was discouraged
and certainly baffled.</p>
<p>“Don’t lose heart,” Roger urged, “we’ll get everything
to come out right. All you need is one tiny hint
of the truth.”</p>
<p>“I must have a dozen,” groaned his cousin. “What
good are they? My wits seem to be fogged.” He looked
disheartened. “I can’t get my old sense of proportion.
Everything seems crazy and impossible. You can’t
enter an electrically sealed room! You can’t open a
safe protected by water-jets and high voltage streams.
You can’t take camera pictures of animals jumping
around where no animals are visible to the eye!”</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> can’t,” Roger tried to be jolly and pretend to
make a joke. “But <i>you</i> will see how somebody else
did. When we had that mystery about the revengeful
man who nearly sent a chemist crazy, all you needed
was one hint. I happened to be lucky enough——”</p>
<p>“Smart enough!”</p>
<p>“Well—I caught the sound that got me named the
Ear Detective. I’m going to live up to my reputation.”</p>
<p>He crossed and stood in front of the downcast
cousin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>“<i>You</i> solved the puzzle. You were called, in magazine
articles in true-mystery write-ups—and by the
newspaper men—the Mystery Wizard, who solved
scientifically from one tiny sound-clue that haunted-laboratory
thing. You’ll do the same with this.”</p>
<p>Grover failed to snap out of his dejection.</p>
<p>“You run up and get out your requisitions for
needed supplies,” Grover suggested. “I will check up
that Clark man, and try to work out a course of action.”</p>
<p>Roger obeyed.</p>
<p>His work was light, and after laying out dark-room
supplies, a set of new distributor points and a replacement
insulator on their high-voltage transformer
line, and a few other needs, he sat down to try to
think out some way to help Grover.</p>
<p>With pencil and paper he carried out a decision
made during their chat.</p>
<p>In a list, on the order they had come, he put down
the sounds he thought might be important, and even
those that did not seem to have any bearing on the
mystery. Opposite them, he set down as many interpretations
as he could figure out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>His list, finished, he scanned thoughtfully. It ran:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tbody><tr class="th"><th><i>Sound</i> </th><th><i>Meanings</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Clicks and hisses on film. </td><td class="l">Claws on glass cage. Rats clawing at the glass inside to get out. Might be a clue to something.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A faint click in headset. </td><td class="l">A distant
 relay switching in on a heating oil-burner. Some electrical device
somewhere. Does not seem much because it didn’t have any effects after
it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A thump in the corner of the upstairs room before I started the camera. </td><td class="l">Some
 trash in the corner shifted. A film in its can shifted. The wall
contracting. Plaster fell. It started me taking pictures that turned out
 to have animals, when none were there, but I do not see any bearing on
our case.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">The Voice of Doom. </td><td class="l">A hoarse voice coming from a room with nobody there. Ventriloquism. Important, but how?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">The Voice of Doom’s cry. </td><td class="l">Either
somebody screaming and being tortured, or somebody pretending it. Or
some natural sound like a fog-siren. Must be important. Might be a clue
to some place or person.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">The last two on a record. </td><td class="l">Both sounds just like before and clear. Same meanings I think. Must be clues. But how?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">The record of same in Dr. Ryder’s room. </td><td class="l">Like the others, only rougher as if it had been made with the needle out of exact adjustment, but strong sounds.</td></tr>

<p>He seemed not to remember any more. He studied
his list, trying to find others to add, new interpretations;
but to no avail.</p>
<p>He thought that if he tried increasing and adding
radio-frequency tuning and amplification to his
speaker-circuit—make it a regular radio, in fact, he
might get any possible radio sending if that could account
for the silent spaces on the last record.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>He made his circuits up, set the electric pick-up
over the start of the record; but with the new hookup
he got no new slant.</p>
<p>Only one small addition to his list of sounds, bringing
his total up to eleven sound-clues—possibly—was
the little thump, or thud that the needle transmitted
before starting in on the voice with no speaker answering
in its silent waits. Roger could get no further.</p>
<p>He took his series of eleven sounds, including the
alarm bell and the thump that could have been a tiny
flaw of the record just on the sound track, and went
to Grover.</p>
<p>“Here are the sounds,” he declared. “Maybe one
will clear up all your tangles.”</p>
<p>At least, studying the list, Grover was more alert,
less depressed, Roger saw with relief.</p>
<p>He examined the last-made record for the fault that
made the odd jarring of its recording. No flaw showed,
even under magnification.</p>
<p>“It’s actually part of the record,” he got Grover to
add to his list of notes; and then he said to his cousin,
“it may mean that the locks went off, somehow, just
there.”</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t record the re-locking, so that doesn’t
fit.”</p>
<p>“If only we could see any cause for that thumping
sound,” Roger reflected out loud. “We might have
one more real clue.”</p>
<p>If only he had been able to decode the key hidden
there!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br>Chapter 12
<br>DETECTIVE ROGER</h2>
<p>After further consideration of the sound
clues, and discussion of the uncanny appearance of
animals on a film, and other points, and without seeing
any light, Grover rose.</p>
<p>“The staff will be arriving any time, now,” said he.
“Let’s look up that fellow, Joseph Z. Clark, because
I want you to do a little Sherlock-Hawkshaw work if
we locate his address.”</p>
<p>They took first the telephone book. He was listed,
and his address was in a section of the suburbs given
over to large private estates. His business also was
listed. He was a jeweler, and the reason he could
own an estate was shown by his business address in
fashionable Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>“A man would seem to be a suspicious character
loitering around a private estate,” Grover looked up,
“but a boy——”</p>
<p>“I could wear my old sweater and cap, and ride
my bicycle, and it would be natural for me to rest
anywhere along the road, or even go anywhere to ask
my way.” Roger caught the spirit of the idea.</p>
<p>“I merely want you to ‘look over the land,’ and
see how things look,” Grover insisted. “Then after
the staff goes, come back and report. That gives you
time for rest between riding out and back.”</p>
<p>“After the staff goes—Do you still think?——”</p>
<p>“I have to think everything and nothing until I
get a lead.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Roger took his time riding the dozen miles to the
easily located point of espionage. To get there by mid-morning
was best.</p>
<p>The estate itself, walled in with ivy-covered stone,
quite an extensive acreage, he reached as the sun approached
the zenith.</p>
<p>Near what seemed to be a servants’ gateway he sat
down by his reclining bicycle.</p>
<p>From the grass beside the gateway he could see,
along the driveway, the beautifully rolled tennis
court, the sweep of lovely lawn, from the main gateway,
winding up to a grand, white mansion, people
moving about on wide verandas or swimming in a
distant pool.</p>
<p>“Pretty swell,” Roger told himself musingly. “Not
the sort of a place to look for kidnapers or jewel
thieves. Unless—as Grover is always so fond of saying:
‘I dig past appearances that can be falsified, to the
heart of truth that can’t be changed.’”</p>
<p>He turned it over in his mind. Of course, it would
not be past reason that a prosperous man, with a
millionaire’s residence, might smuggle gems, even
make a man his prisoner to secure a gem with the
world-wide reputation Doctor Ryder had ascribed to
the Eye of Om.</p>
<p>Om—Roger had looked it up—was the reverent
name by which the Tibetans referred to the All Highest,
to Our Eternal Father.</p>
<p>It was sometimes spelled A-u-m, also, he had found
out.</p>
<p>From his view of the rich, scintillating gem, the
unbelievably many, tiny, flat, facet surfaces, turned in
every direction, well symbolised the name, the Eye
of Aum or Om, the All-seeing Gaze of the Supreme God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Well, for that jewel, what would not some characters
do?</p>
<p>He wondered, gazing idly, behind which window
Doctor Ryder might be a prisoner; and he thought
how he might discover it.</p>
<p>If the man could look out, he thought, Doctor
Ryder might give him some signal.</p>
<p>He stood up, pretending to stretch, facing the
house. He got up on the wall, and knew that he was
noticed, for a footman moved out toward him. He
jumped down, watching the upper windows.</p>
<p>No response. No signal. If only he could be seen
from all four sides of the house, he reflected, it might
be different!</p>
<p>“Private property, son,” said the footman, arriving
at the gate.</p>
<p>Some remembrance of detectives who had “taken
the bull by the horns” and had “bluffed” people into
telling the truth, who had tricked suspected people
into revealing things they tried to hide, made Roger
act without fully canvassing what the possible outcome
might be.</p>
<p>“Private, yes,” he said, grinning mysteriously, “but
you’d better ask Doctor Ryder whether I’d be called
a trespasser or not.”</p>
<p>His bold stroke brought him a revealing response.</p>
<p>“Huh? Doctor Ryder? Do you know him?”</p>
<p>“I know him,” Roger said loftily, “better than he
knows the Eye of Om.”</p>
<p>“The what of who?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>“Oh, of course—I ought not to have mentioned——”
Roger pretended to be disconcerted, “I—uh—well,
never mind.”</p>
<p>“How comes it you’re out here? Why’n’t you ride
right on in if you want the Doctor?”</p>
<p>“I just stopped to rest.”</p>
<p>If Roger’s words were carelessly intoned, his heart
was doing speed-pulsations. Doctor Ryder was there!</p>
<p>“Well, all right. They didn’t know who you were,
climbing on our wall.” (<i>Our</i> wall—Roger hid a grin.)</p>
<p>“Guess I’ll walk up. Want to bring my machine?”</p>
<p>Might as well enjoy some of the luxury of having
servants to wait on him, Roger chuckled merrily to
himself.</p>
<p>“Certainly, sir. You will find Doctor Ryder with
Mister Clark, over beyond the pool, at the first tee
of the golf links. Or, would you rather be announced?”</p>
<p>“‘Station O.B.Y’s,’” Roger pretended to be a radio
announcer, playing on the phrase, “Oh, be wise,” as
he shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I’ll go see the doctor without being
heralded.”</p>
<p>He walked ahead of the servant, across the lawn.</p>
<p>Before he had passed the girls with gay frocks, joking
with their escorts, and the quartet of laughing,
splashing swimmers, he saw the man he had supposed
to be a prisoner.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, his bald head and plump frame
easily discernible, was certainly as free as the tall,
sallow, thin-cheeked, hatless man in white flannels
who was swinging a golf club over a ball.</p>
<p>“Why—Roger!” The doctor, turning, recognized
him as he approached, “How’d you locate me so soon?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Roger, coming up, on guard, hiding his surprise
at the unexpected freedom of the man, took on a
careless air of wisdom.</p>
<p>“Science!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you laboratory people!” Doctor Ryder smiled.
“So my voice <i>did</i> make a record.” He turned to the
other man, “I told you that disconnecting the
selenium cell wire wouldn’t stop the sound from getting
onto the film, any more than you could stop the
motor, even if you did keep it from taking your
picture by holding the card by a rubber band snapped
over the lens barrel.”</p>
<p>The other man laughed.</p>
<p>“They may have your voice, and welcome,” he
chuckled, giving the rather flabbergasted young detective
a cheerful grin of welcome, “but they didn’t
get my picture, and they won’t have my voice, because—well,
young man, how do you imagine I beat
that?”</p>
<p>“Wrote your answers,” said Roger after an instant
of thought.</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>“I told you he was clever—who wouldn’t be under
the Mystery Wizard, as his older relative is sometimes
referred to.” Doctor Ryder slapped Roger’s left
shoulder.</p>
<p>Roger, cautious, eyes alert, saw no signs of duplicity.</p>
<p>The situation puzzled him.</p>
<p>After all of the mysterious, baffling, weird and unexplained
circumstances, after the strain and excitement,
here was the victim of capture and jewel robbery,
about to play golf, laughing, free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Were “appearances” cheating his common sense?
He decided to pretend to accept conditions, but he
watched alertly for clues.</p>
<p>“But I expect you are surprised to see this situation,”
the man who owned these acres of wealth declared.</p>
<p>Roger could not dissemble well enough.</p>
<p>“No fair keeping him in the dark,” Doctor Ryder
prompted. “I was going to telephone, but we had
some details to work out over a few holes of Scotch
Croquet,” he laughed at his own allusion to golf. “So
you sleuthed me anyhow. Well, let’s put our cards on
the table.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Mr. Clark—the footman’s identification—said.</p>
<p>“I was getting the Voice of Doom manifestation
again when—how, only he can reveal—this old traveling
chum, who has gone further in making money
than I have in curing spinal disease,” Doctor Ryder
was speaking, “stalked into my room.”</p>
<p>“Well, I knew you were in danger,” the other remarked.
“So I just went in through a cellar window
and up the stairs, and just as the Tibetans were getting
the hang of the slotted cable trick to shut off the
current so they could walk in, I knocked down the
ring-leader.”</p>
<p>Could that have been the thump on the record,
Roger asked himself.</p>
<p>“They had a copperized gadget, and so I chased the
other two, and used the gadget, walked in, and
brought my old chum out here.”</p>
<p>“You might have saved us a lot of worry,” Roger
spoke abruptly. “We thought all sorts of terrible
things about you, doctor.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>“But I said, at the end of the record, that we would
go to the safe, and if all was well there we would come
here and communicate.”</p>
<p>“The record ran out before it was spoken,” said
Roger, and he added:</p>
<p>“Well—did you find the jewel safe?”</p>
<p>“Just as Clark drove us up near the laboratory,”
Doctor Ryder informed him, “we saw the Tibetans
emerge. How they had worked it is beyond me. But
we let them start in a car, trailed it, and when they
got out we jumped them, and after a tussle, sure
enough!—they had this, so we took charge.”</p>
<p>There, in his palm, lay the great, flashing emerald!</p>
<p>“Matter of fact,” Clark spoke up, “as long as your
laboratory Chief won’t help my friend to restore this
to Tibet and escape all the danger—and worse—that
those Tibetans can stage, I am going to finance his
trip back to Tibet, and may even go along.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Roger, swinging on the soft turf,
“I’d better tell Grover to stop worrying himself about
your protection and all.”</p>
<p>“You can call from the house—a servant will show
you where,” the estate owner suggested, and Roger
saw no trickery or exchange of glances to tell him
anything was deceptive in their manner. “While you
are telling him, if you like the idea, you might ask if
he can give a good young radio operator a leave-of-absence
to go along. We have had a Roger, the Ear
Detective, so far. We’d be willing to pay expenses
and salary to a Roger, the Scientist, on our trip to
restore a priceless religious symbol.”</p>
<p>Roger’s jaw dropped, sagging with his astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>“Straight goods,” added Doctor Ryder. “The
Tibetan priests are bugs about scientific cleverness.
You’d be a help.”</p>
<p>“Name your own salary, too,” added Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>Roger may have set his feet on greensward; but to
him it was as if he walked on clouds.</p>
<p>But he did not ask Grover over the telephone.</p>
<p><i>He</i> was not so sure about that frank offer.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><br>Chapter 13
<br>SCIENTIST ROGER</h2>
<p>Brought back to the laboratory in Mr.
Clark’s car, with one of the servants delegated to drive
the estate carry-all in with his bicycle, Roger got a
new surprise.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark greeted their bio-chemist and their electrical
specialist, respectively Mr. Zendt and Mr.
Ellison, as long-missed brothers.</p>
<p>“We attended the same technical college,” he told
Grover.</p>
<p>“And did we have experiences in India?” chuckled
Ellison.</p>
<p>To himself Roger thought that here was some likely
link with the kangaroo and, perhaps, with the ape of
the first startling night’s alarm.</p>
<p>He kept his thoughts behind his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>“But why must you restore the Eye, at so much
risk?” Grover, put in possession of facts already known
to Roger, asked, “Turn it over to those mysterious
Tibetans who open safes and enter sealed rooms.”</p>
<p>“That’s the rub,” Clark declared. “Are they genuine
priests? Or thieves?”</p>
<p>“The Voice of Doom is a genuine manifestation,
apparently,” Doctor Ryder added, “at least, in the
mountain temple, I heard something similar to the
screaming doom. In some way they produce that noise,
on a much greater scale of volume. It is said to be the
Voice of Doom, and is supposed to come through the
lips of their image of Buddha, as an omen, only when
a criminal is being judged by the image, which is to
say by the temple priests—or before some calamity
such as an earthquake or famine year.”</p>
<p>“But maybe these fellows are using that, and pretending
to be priests from the Forbidden Land, to
scare us into giving up the gem,” Mr. Clark argued.</p>
<p>Real priests, bent on revenge, he insisted, struck
first, spoke afterward, if at all. Or, these might be of
some other sect or lamasery, as they called their
mountain retreats.</p>
<p>“I can see that,” Ellison agreed.</p>
<p>“It is not from them so much comes the danger to
Ryder,” Zendt was also a champion, “More from
the hidden menace of the real Doom comes it.”</p>
<p>“If I could get away,” said Ellison, “I’d take back
the thing for Ryder.”</p>
<p>“It is my risk. I got into this thing.”</p>
<p>“But why do you suggest taking Roger, Doctor?”
Grover asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>“Several reasons. First: he has proved that he is
accurate in discerning the correct interpretation of
sounds, which leads to the next: he is clever at
photography and other scientific means of getting accurate
data. To explain that, let me say that with so
much danger if it were known that I meant to get
into the temple, a secret way to restore the Eye would
be safer.</p>
<p>“There is a hidden way to enter the temple. I do
not know it, but I feel that in some way it may be
connected with that Voice of Doom, and Roger could
photograph, enlarge his takes, study them, and with
his sharp eye and keen wit, could no doubt find the
secret.”</p>
<p>“A last reason,” Mr. Clark added, “is that he can
operate a radio-telephone, as well as send wireless
code. We might want the former, if two parties,
separated, needed to keep in constant touch. The latter,
short-wave sending and receiving, could keep us
in touch with the outside world—even with you, Mr.
Mystery Wizard Brown.”</p>
<p>Put that way, there seemed less to make Roger uncertain.</p>
<p>What an adventure!</p>
<p>“If you could spare that husky, loyal general assistant,
Potts,” suggested the doctor, “we could ask
no better guardian for your cousin.”</p>
<p>There was much to be considered; there was much
apparatus to be designed and assembled, including
compact, tiny cameras, hand-operated generator to
supply current where electricity never had been used,
light, but powerful step-up transformers: there had
to be clothing and other traveling needs in sparsely
settled Tibet to be planned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Time, though, coupled with a spirit of eagerness,
helps in such plans, and it was soon time to say good-bye,
to wave from the moving train, to hear Tip shout,
“At last we got everything coagulated. We’re off!”
and to settle back in a parlor car seat until time to
go into the diner.</p>
<p>Across America, and on the ship bearing the party
toward the International Date Line in the Pacific
where one day changed to another by the simple
process of crossing the imaginary line—the way that
the astronomers had worked out to adjust Time to
the sun’s progress—and even when they landed in
China, only slight evidence had been noticed that
the effort to secure the gem was still alive in some one’s
mind.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder felt that it indicated that the
Tibetans had really been the ones after the Eye; and
the ransacking of a despatch box, in their hotel room
in San Francisco, he thought, had been the work of
an international jewel thief.</p>
<p>Roger, while they crossed the Republic of China
from Shanghai, had plenty to interest him, and so
did Potts.</p>
<p>That loyal if uneducated guardian voiced his astonishment
at the unusual sights and experiences.</p>
<p>“No wonder they say these people are backward,”
he told Roger. “They do everything hind-side-first.
Men wear skirts and women wear pajamas. They
build a station where there ain’t any railroad at all,
and have roads where there ain’t any traffic to use
’em.”</p>
<p>“Well, to them that is their way. They think our
way is back-ways.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>“It is all in the point of view,” Mr. Clark took part
in the chat. “Everything depends on how you look at
it. The moon looks far off if you reverse your telescope,
yet a star looks closer from the right end of
the same instrument.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” Tip was stubborn about his idea,
“They <i>are</i> a backward race. Look at that!”</p>
<p>“That” was a rickshaw boy, drawing his two wheeled
carriage with two American tourist women in it. The
boy deliberately swerved and ran across the street just
in front of the automobile, the traveling companions
and Roger were using. The driver had to stand on
his brakes.</p>
<p>“They think devils chase them, and if they turn
right-angles and run in front of something, <i>it</i> runs
over the devils that can’t turn corners.” Potts was
disgusted.</p>
<p>Other strange customs—strange because different
from American habit—kept them alert and amused as
they progressed toward the place where arrangements
had been made for the party to join a caravan that
was on its way across Tibet bearing tea and other
Chinese goods. It seemed safest to go into the restricted
territory as if bent on passing through it. Camels,
with great fuss and grumbling, swift ponies with
many whickers of eagerness to gallop rather than walk
or trot, got under way and Roger, swaying on his
Ship of the Desert, bound, seemingly, for the Kybur
Pass and India, smiled as Potts found his curious
steed inducing a seasickness that made him prefer
to walk a good part of the time, unless the pace was
too swift, when Tip rode and suffered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>As arranged, at one of the halting places, during
the night, the quartet, met by guides and bearers as
arranged for by the caravan leader, quietly forsook
the caravan, and rode, on wiry ponies, into darkness
and a land over which brooded the mysterious, terrible
Himalayas.</p>
<p>Far away, in a city laboratory, with Roger’s chum,
Billy Summers, an expert radio “op,” Grover tuned
a set, amplified, increasing output strength; and then,
as Roger, in the Tibetan night, increased his own
signal power as Tip ground at the generator, each
knew that with the other all was well. Yes. Just then!</p>
<h2 id="c15"><br>Chapter 14
<br>CAPTIVE ROGER</h2>
<p>Across the Tibetan plain, with its sparse
vegetation and occasional small and always distant
group of rude huts surrounded by the grazing herd
of the tiny community, the party made its way uneventfully.</p>
<p>Steadily the ground grew higher. Constantly the
Backbone of the World, the great, forbidding, brooding
Himalayan range, was a larger part of the landscape
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The guides, through an interpreter whose English
was almost minus, but who could understand Doctor
Ryder’s pantomime and few recalled Tibetan phrases,
had agreed reluctantly that they would avoid settled
parts and keep away from villages. His hesitation was
due, as was explained, to the greater danger of being
set upon by bandits, or rough peasants who amounted
to the same thing. Yet that experience came.</p>
<p>At dusk, as they ate tinned food and the natives
laid aside packs, cared for the wiry ponies and made
camp, the chief guide discerned the approach of a
dozen riders, galloping their sturdy mounts in a cluster
toward them.</p>
<p>Tip, with a grunt, snatched at his revolver. Mr.
Clark, almost in a snarl, ordered him not to show it.</p>
<p>“We must be diplomatic,” the man added; and
Doctor Ryder agreed.</p>
<p>“Roger,” he said to the excited, trembling young
scientific representative, “can’t you get something
ready that might startle them or look like magic?”</p>
<p>Roger, in spite of his misgivings, thought hard.</p>
<p>“Come here, Tip.” Together, conferring, they unpacked
equipment.</p>
<p>As the silent, but menacing horsemen deployed and
surrounded the camp, the youth drew on, hastily,
heavy rubber gloves.</p>
<p>Tip, not too sure that he ought to be so far from
his charge, obeyed stern orders to carry out Roger’s
instructions, and in the tent, sat by the handle of the
generator. The small electricity-producing unit,
much more powerful, though no heavier than an
automobile battery-generator, had its handle and flywheel
geared at a high ratio, so that moderate turning
rate gave the armature its correct impetus for best
results.</p>
<p>From it, unseen in the darkness that came on, a
wire ran to a spot where Roger crouched, apparently
busy with cooking utensils.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The bandits dismounted, and the group advanced,
completely surrounding the white men, who wore
the native coats of rough texture but who did not
attempt to disguise their race.</p>
<p>The natives of the camp were evidently expecting
the raid, and Roger was sure that either the chief
guide or an aide had betrayed them.</p>
<p>It was too late to avoid the encounter and recriminations
were not wise.</p>
<p>“You give all money,” the interpreter told Doctor
Ryder as the leader of their adversaries spoke in guttural
phrases.</p>
<p>“Tell him we are scientists, going to study the great
rocks. Tell him that we have no money, and bid him
go, before we ask our young magician, who is close
in the councils of the Gods, to smite them.”</p>
<p>The interpreter apparently gave the interpretation
faithfully, from his gestures toward Roger; but the
man he addressed gave a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>He spoke to his men and they roared and shouted
in mockery.</p>
<p>“Bid him go, then, and try his strength to capture
that small youth who cooks the broth that gives him
the strength of the Mountain Gods.”</p>
<p>As Clark gave the phrases, he glanced at Roger.</p>
<p>Probably, Roger thought, the man was afraid that
he would fail at this critical moment. Be afraid. Or
show nervousness.</p>
<p>The bandit leader guffawed, and strode rapidly,
and menacingly, in Roger’s direction.</p>
<p>“It’s your move, son,” Roger mentally admonished
himself. “Steady.”</p>
<p>To Tip he called, very low, “Get set.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Tip called back, “Say when.”</p>
<p>The bandit strode close.</p>
<p>“Om, man-u, pad-mi, om,” muttered Roger, using
the prayer so familiar to all Buddhists in Tibet.</p>
<p>The man paused, looking a trifle surprised at the
sound.</p>
<p>Roger, upsetting a pan of water on the earth, rose,
standing near the wet space.</p>
<p>In words taught him by the interpreter, he spoke.</p>
<p>“What do you seek?” his phrase demanded, and his
voice he kept very steady, even stern.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>The man, depending on surprise, made a quick
grab, as Roger laid aside a fork and with apparent
aimlessness, paying no heed—outwardly—took in his
right hand a big iron ladle to stir the boiling soup.</p>
<p>As if unaware of the plan to attack, he went on,
“Om man-u pad-mi om,” knowing that the first utterance
had started Tip to whirling his generator
armature.</p>
<p>The man made a grab. As though turning, Roger
maneuvered so that his ladle was just where the man
made the grab—but Roger was beyond the wet spot
on which the man stepped.</p>
<p>Stepped up to stronger voltage, carried along the
wire fixed to the ladle handle held in his rubber-gloved
hand, Roger was immune to the current that
had better conductivity through the man standing on
wet earth.</p>
<p>As his hand closed on the metal, with a startled,
frightened howl, the bandit writhed and was convulsed,
more by surprise than by any vast voltage. It
was enough to jar, not enough to harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>But he could not let go.</p>
<p>“Cease firing,” Roger called, amused as the man
was contorted by the tingling, nerve-throbbing current
that he could not understand.</p>
<p>The others, standing with mouths agape, saw their
leader fall back, in awe, rubbing his arms. He spoke
abruptly, staring at Roger unbelievingly. Then he
drew back, and discussed his experience in guttural
grunts and abrupt gestures.</p>
<p>Roger, knowing that the generator was still, stirred
the soup nonchalantly while the interpreter, on
whispered instructions, put a brave front on the situation
and demanded that the group go away before all
should feel the stronger wrath of their super-man.</p>
<p>They did draw aside, conferring. But they would
not go. They took their mounts, but sat on guard.</p>
<p>Roger, eating with his companions, suggested that
if they could demonstrate some visual marvel, such as
a picture projected onto a light-colored tent side, it
might frighten away the men.</p>
<p>The guides did not think they would be bothered,
the interpreter said. The men would not go. They
would stay on guard, and by keeping the party surrounded,
not molesting for fear of more harmful acts,
but still preventing them from moving, the bandits
would wait for instructions from some one in higher
authority. A messenger had ridden away.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, while they sat around their
fire of native fuel, they saw, approaching, the messenger
and another tall Tibetan who dismounted and
approached. He wore the recognizable garb of a Lama.</p>
<p>“Show me your magician,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Roger, assuming a brave air, arose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>“Come,” the man beckoned, “you will show me
your wonders. I will show you mine.”</p>
<p>“Better go,” whispered Clark. “He will take you
just where we want to get. Take Tip, and a radio, the
battery set. And keep in touch.”</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br>Chapter 15
<br>IN THE LAMASERY</h2>
<p>If the urging of the jeweler and of Doctor
Ryder seemed like sacrificing Roger, they assured him
that it was not so.</p>
<p>The lama, they declared, was interested in anything
seeming to be occult or mystifying or a use of
hidden forces. His attitude was not menacing. Rather,
it seemed friendly.</p>
<p>And he was a lama from the very temple they
sought!</p>
<p>“What a break!” Tip, whose companionship the
man readily agreed to, as Tip carried the portable
battery, compact five-tube set, telephone instrument
and spare B. battery, spoke under his breath.</p>
<p>“This will coagulate everything, make it easy,” he
added.</p>
<p>Roger, somewhat excited at the prospect of going
into strange adventures, being “on his own,” nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The man’s attitude was respectful and friendly.
The bandits stayed around the camp, but the interpreter
said that if the youth satisfied his companion
of his abilities, it might free them, might even help
them to reach their objective.</p>
<p>The lama had evidently been at a village not very
far away: they had only to walk to that, and then,
with much show of veneration for the lama, their
holy man or priest, the villagers furnished ponies.</p>
<p>Roger, mounted and riding beside his friendly
captor, with Tip and his apparatus on another pony
and on a led carrier-animal, noted the tiny prayer-wheels
by the ascending roadside, saw the other lamas
they met with their prayer-wheels and prayer-papers,
observed the reverent attitude of the peasants herding
cattle or grazing sheep, and felt a renewed confidence
in the outcome.</p>
<p>The lama could not converse with him, but the
universal language of look and gesture served very
well between them.</p>
<p>In due course, after riding up steeper and steeper
paths, into the craggy, ravine-and-cliff torn mountains,
they came to a great, dreary, uninviting stone
monastery wherein the lamas stayed, studying, praying
and conducting the strange rites of their religion.</p>
<p>“If you ask me,” muttered Tip, scanning the looming
pile of stone, “We are a long way from the lab.
What’s all them little windmills for?”</p>
<p>“Prayer-wheels,” Roger told him. “They say their
prayers with them.”</p>
<p>“Well if you think I’m going to end up by spinning
one of them whirligigs, you’re wrong. Tell this bird
I’m incontrovertible.”</p>
<p>“You’re what?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>“Incontrovertible. I won’t change my religion.”</p>
<p>“Not convert-ible. I see. Still the same old Tip, far
though you are, as you say, from Grover’s dark-room.
But they seem to look up to this man who brought
us. He’s sort of bossy, too, and they mind.”</p>
<p>They were made as comfortable as the rude conditions
of the cold, harsh life the lamas led would allow.</p>
<p>Roger was glad that Tip was not separated from
him. They were both given one cell, a gloomy, but
not prison-like cell that looked out through its narrow
window over a vast, tumbled, fissure-creased
series of crags and ravines, cliffs and snow-covered
peaks.</p>
<p>It was as though the Creator of the world had flung
this wild mass of rock helter-skelter, in a long backbone,
to hold the world together.</p>
<p>Simple, not too palatable food was ungrudgingly
served, and their conductor visited them several times
to see that they needed nothing he could offer.</p>
<p>The radio-telephone, answered by Doctor Ryder,
reassured them. The bandits had been sent away by
abrupt orders from another lama. Not a can of food
or a bit of apparatus had been disturbed or taken.</p>
<p>The communicating sets worked well, and things
were not so bad.</p>
<p>The gaunt, silent, stern-faced lamas served them
without comment or objection; and Tip and Roger
were allowed to roam at will through most of the
corridors, rooms, cells and even were permitted to
attend the chanting devotions of the men in a huge
chapel-like place. But that, they were certain, was not
the “temple” because there was no Buddha of the
stature they expected, or with a spare Eye either
missing or replaced by an imitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>But nothing advanced. Nothing happened. Days
dragged by.</p>
<p>The explanation came when their captor, or host,
brought them into a sort of general community room,
where he presented them before a very sedate and
reserved and cold-visaged old man. Roger, however,
did not feel any fear, because the man’s eyes seemed
to hold some deep, broad-minded tolerance. He
looked kindly.</p>
<p>To their amazement he addressed Roger in halting,
but clear English.</p>
<p>“You come far.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Tip spoke first.</p>
<p>“You come for what?”</p>
<p>Tip hesitated.</p>
<p>Roger came forward.</p>
<p>“This man and I are with a scientific expedition.”</p>
<p>“Have you secured permission to enter our land?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so,” Roger, himself, was not too certain
about the details of that official permit that Doctor
Ryder said he had gotten.</p>
<p>“You understand something of science?”</p>
<p>Roger admitted it, not boastfully.</p>
<p>Their things were all brought in.</p>
<p>“Show me, and tell me.”</p>
<p>Roger, trying to use short words and simple explanations,
demonstrated the radio-telephone, and
its purpose of distant communication.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>He did not want to explain the tiny camera, and
put it into the case with the spare battery, pretending
that it was part of the apparatus therein. The watching
chief lama and the venerable visitor gave no special
attention to it and Roger was glad. He had it in
case they got near the temple and he could try to
discover, from its pictures, later enlarged, how the
secret way into the edifice, if one existed, was
manipulated.</p>
<p>Contriving to “raise” his other friends, by the set,
Roger allowed the lama and the other to hear the
reply to his guarded declaration that they were being
well nourished, made much of, and so on.</p>
<p>When the men seemed satisfied and the paraphernalia
of radio was removed, the gentleman at the
head of the lamas considered Roger and Tip thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Indeed great progress has been made in your
America,” he said, to Roger, while the lama sat silent.
“Even you, not more than thirteen, surely, accomplish
what would be wizardry to our own peasants—and
yet this Forbidden Land holds locked in her
bosom the destinies of tomorrow’s science, and knowledge
of forces that your America does not dream of.
It is a strange old world.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Roger agreed, not knowing how else to
respond, then:</p>
<p>“How do you come to know our language, sir?”</p>
<p>“Your own sacred Book tells of the—is it not the
Tower of Babel?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And is there not the word that prophets, as fire
descended upon their heads, spoke ‘with many
tongues’?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>“We, in Tibet, have methods for reproducing many
miracles—as they would seem to you, for all of your
scientific wisdom. Let me show you.”</p>
<p>As though understanding what was to come, the
lama approached, and under the steady gaze of the
other, seemed to assume a trance-like fixedness of expression.
Standing, his body was still rigid, but he did
not sway or totter or fall.</p>
<p>Presently, as Roger and Tip watched, knowing it
might be hypnotism, but still marveling at the produced
result, they heard:</p>
<p>“I am in a great laboratory.” And the man used
perfect English, not even slightly inflected as had
been that of the other, “There is an office with a pair
of desks. At one, a woman typewrites. At the other,
Grover Brown interviews his staff, and tells what
Roger has sent him by the Morse code and which he
‘picked up’ on four stages of radio-frequency and three
audio.”</p>
<p>It was almost weird, uncanny. Of course, there
might be such a thing as mind-reading—but——</p>
<p>“In the chemical division, a man, Zendt, experiments
with tissue, and a new—to him—process for
causing a medicinal reaction by the application of
Ellison’s sun-lamp.</p>
<p>“But here—Roger fails to tell completely of his
mechanism. He forgets to explain the tiny camera
with which he hopes to discover a secret way into our
temple——”</p>
<p>If Roger’s face was controlled in time, perhaps
Tip’s was not.</p>
<p>The older man smiled, a little wryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>“That will do.” He clapped his hands sharply. The
lama, with a somewhat dazed look, flexed his muscles
and stumbling to a seat, collapsed on it. Magic?
Trickery? Roger had no time to decide.</p>
<p>“If you are so anxious to learn our secrets of the
temple,” remarked the old man, “you shall have
them. Indeed, you shall even hear——”</p>
<p>Roger grew tense as he paused and then finished:</p>
<p>“The Voice of Doom! Come!”</p>
<h2 id="c17"><br>Chapter 16
<br>THE IMAGE SPEAKS</h2>
<p>With an abrupt change the atmosphere
seemed to be charged with electricity. Of course,
thought Roger, trying to remain cool, it was merely
his fear of the outcome that made his nerves tingle.</p>
<p>There was no time for any choice of action.</p>
<p>Rising, the old man moved toward an arched opening
at one side of the stone chamber. Tip, fierce-eyed,
loyal, beside Roger, realized as he tugged at his empty
holster that in some clever way he had been disarmed.
A glance behind him showed the mocking lama,
holding his own weapon. Tip gauged the chances of
a leap, shrugged. It was useless. Monastery attendants
were at all the open doorways.</p>
<p>“Buck up!” he whispered.</p>
<p>“It may not be so bad,” Roger tried to reassure
them both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>They followed, as follow they must, down a long,
echoing, empty corridor. Far away, low, weird, they
could hear male voices, deep, rather disturbing in
tone, chanting some uncouth succession of notes.</p>
<p>Their slow walk behind the aged conductor brought
them constantly nearer to the chant, for the voices
grew louder.</p>
<p>At a doorway, heavily shrouded in lustrous woven
velvet or other drapery, the guide swung, and an attendant,
bowing, moved the cloth to one side. The
chanting swelled suddenly.</p>
<p>Resistance was futile. As the guide moved aside,
motioning, Roger, and Tip after him, passed under
the great stone door-lintel, into a large square chamber
full of the chanting lamas.</p>
<p>And at the end, in a niche, on a sort of raised dais,
sat the huge carved wooden image or statue of the
Meditating Buddha or prophet of their religion, and
in its forehead glowed, in the flickering torchlight,
the great, green duplicate—it appeared—of the Eye
of Om.</p>
<p>At first it flashed through Roger’s mind that this
was strange; but at once he realized that, of course,
they would have replaced the gem with a substitute
or an imitation, and would not tell many of the loss.</p>
<p>Thrust forward by the lama who had brought them
there, Roger and Potts were ushered down the aisle
between rows of kneeling, low-and-mocking-voiced
monks or lamas, to the space below the great figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Words in Tibetan, answered by hoarse responses
from the crowd, seemed to be some ceremony or invocation
of judgment, in which, they sensed, the two
white people were the sacrifice or center of the rite.
Standing silently, Tip was watchful but helpless.
Roger, too, kept an alert mind but saw no means of
escape.</p>
<p>“You seek to hear the Voice. You wish to know the
secret.”</p>
<p>The venerable man who appeared to be some sort
of super-lama, to whom even their former captor
deferred, knelt and pronounced some low, weird and
long-winded invocation.</p>
<p>At his gesture they both knelt, submissive if not
willing, and he bowed his head to the floor and stayed
that way.</p>
<p>All the rest were in similar positions.</p>
<p>And then, blood-curdling in its startling suddenness,
after an interval of suspense, there came, but not
softly or in small volume as in their recordings it had
been, a scream that was as weird as the howl of a soul
in torment; and after it followed, louder, but duplicating,
the decreasing pitch and growing volume of
the howl, roar and groan, that ceased abruptly on a
hoarse note.</p>
<p>Apparently, and they all seemed to believe it, the
Image had spoken.</p>
<p>Certainly, to Roger, still able to be alert enough
to trace sound, it issued from the head or face, possibly
the small, slitted mouth of that statue.</p>
<p>“The Doom has judged,” the old man told them
in precise English, but in a very formal and cold
tone, “the judgment is pronounced. I am to show
you our secret and allow your science to prove its
worth.”</p>
<p>A mocking twitch took the place of a smile as he
added:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>“Or, from our viewpoint, its worthlessness.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, with no sound an orifice opened in the
wall behind the idol. In its cavernous depths, dark
and forbidding, Roger guessed that the stone had
withdrawn up or sidewise, or had turned on a pivot.</p>
<p>He and Tip, hesitating, were prodded gruffly
forward.</p>
<p>Into the decreasing light they moved—were forced
to move.</p>
<p>The darkness became abruptly intense. The noiseless
door had closed!</p>
<p>Echoing still to their last footstep, the silence slowly
became complete.</p>
<p>“Science!” grunted Tip, “Without no scientific
impediments.”</p>
<p>“Implements.” Roger spoke from habit, still too
dazed to feel, with completeness, the horror that must
soon come.</p>
<p>And far away, the last exhalation of the “s” he had
spoken was flung mockingly back by echo, a hiss of
multiplied duration, fainter as it echoed to and fro.</p>
<p>Trying to hold calm, Roger felt an impulse to
scream, to beat on the callous stone, to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Instead, feeling that Tip also must feel the dread
he felt, he nerved himself to be not only calm, but
matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>“Well,” he remarked, “We’ve heard the Voice and
found the secret way. And that’s that!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br>Chapter 17
<br>BLACK SILENCE</h2>
<p>Without looking up from the radio over
which he was fussing, Doctor Ryder spoke snappishly.
His nerves were on edge.</p>
<p>“We ought not to have brought him.”</p>
<p>“But he was so clever,” protested Clark, “and surely
if anybody ever could interpret what that temple
must hide in that queer sound, he’d be the one. He
interpreted claws on glass, you said—and——”</p>
<p>“Be still. Let me listen.”</p>
<p>The doctor fidgeted, trying to tune, to amplify, to
adjust knobs on the unresponsive radio set.</p>
<p>“We had no intention of getting him into hot
water,” Clark said, morosely. “We did want to get
into that temple. The bandits were unforeseen complications;
but when the Lama came, I thought that
for Roger it would all be simple, once he got into the
lamasery.”</p>
<p>He watched a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Can’t you raise even a whisper?”</p>
<p>“No! And it has been three nights. And besides we
can’t operate the wireless, because you don’t know
code. Brown, in America, will be wild. Our three
days of uncertainty is nothing. He hasn’t heard since
Roger left us, and that was a week before our last
contact with him.”</p>
<p>“Let me try. You go and turn the dynamo.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>“I wish I knew more about it. I know precious little,
come to find out, whether it’s burned out, or the
brushes gone, or how to adjust these things.” The
doctor relinquished his place, went into the tent.</p>
<p>At the tuning dial and control knobs, as he whirled
them and almost frantically called into the telephone
transmitter, Clark worked.</p>
<p>In the tent his companion swung the flywheel over,
and around, and then stopped, groaning.</p>
<p>“Guess we are licked,” he came out.</p>
<p>“You go back. We’ll keep trying.”</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder nodded.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of silence.</p>
<p>“I’m—sh-h-h!”</p>
<p>Clark tuned delicately, getting the “hang” of the
controls.</p>
<p>Out of the receiving diaphragm issued a low, male
voice.</p>
<p>“You will return to your America.”</p>
<p>Desperately Clark swung the switch to the sending
side.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Where is our boy? Roger? Is he
there? Is he——”</p>
<p>“He is gone. The Voice of Doom spoke his sentence.
He has learned the secret of the hidden darkness.”</p>
<p>“We’ll have a hundred thousand American troops
in your darn country if that boy has been hurt——”</p>
<p>The other end of the transmission mocked with a
hoarse laugh.</p>
<p>That was all.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder, informed, looked defeated.</p>
<p>“And all for a tawdry jewel. And we still have——”</p>
<p>Clark motioned for silence, trying desperately,
vainly, to raise a response from the dead ether waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>They retired, at last, because with the glowering
clouds hanging low in a star-obscured sky, with possible
guards in sight, they dared not make a move.</p>
<p>Discussion had been fruitless. They had drawn
only blanks in their search for a course of action.</p>
<p>Clark, lying on his cot, tossing, got up.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep. I’m going to walk around—see if I
can think up some way to find out about Roger—and
that man with him, too, of course, because what happens
to one will happen to the other.”</p>
<p>He went out into the somber blackness of midnight.</p>
<p>Walking did not keep him from brooding, nor help
his brain to do its task.</p>
<p>He sat on a large tussock of dry turf.</p>
<p>“For a tawdry gem!” he muttered.</p>
<p>A slight sound made him leap up, revolver drawn.</p>
<p>Had it been the ever-blowing gale, stirring something?
Or some fresh menace, some creeping creature,
some vindictive priest, who had made that tiny sound
of a scraping shoe?</p>
<p>“Who’s there? Speak or I’ll fire!”</p>
<p>He knew no direction to shoot in. But the light
might disclose something. He raised the weapon.</p>
<p>“Mr. Clark, don’t——”</p>
<p>“<i>Roger!</i>”</p>
<p>“In person, and not a ghost.”</p>
<p>In a heavy sheeps-wool coat, shaggy and rough, the
figure came to his side. His grip of the young hand
was sincerely strong.</p>
<p>“Quick!” Roger gasped, “give me the Eye of Om—I
can exchange it and get back and we can go before
they discover me.”</p>
<p>“Where have you been?” as they walked fast toward
camp. “What happened?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>“They tried us, and the Voice of Doom sentenced
us, and they put us in the chamber behind the image.
But we can’t stop to talk.”</p>
<p>“Are you all right? Is Potts safe?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes. Hurry!”</p>
<p>“Let me go with you.”</p>
<p>“Only hurry, and bring the Eye.”</p>
<p>Dashing into the tent, scattering explanations to
befuddled Doctor Ryder as he broke apart the small
secret compartment in a bedroll and got the gem,
Clark met Roger and handed him the stone.</p>
<p>Instantly Roger fled into the darkness.</p>
<p>When Clark overtook him he saw Potts holding two
ponies. Sending Tip to camp, the pair mounted and
galloped away.</p>
<p>“It was easy to find the secret,” Roger said as they
made a quick ride toward the distant cliffs, “Tip
helped me keep my head. We figured out that somebody
worked the Voice, and it was louder than
human sound. We were in a tunnel. It sloped downwards.
It seemed as though the Buddha image had
howled. That meant a way to get into the image or
open a port from the tunnel to it. Phonograph records
wouldn’t have been their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>“The wind always howled around the lamasery,
up so high. From what we knew about acoustics and
how they shaped the old phonograph horns to increase
sound amplification, we worked it out that we were
in a sort of wind-tunnel or horn, and it didn’t seem
that they opened any rock at the image or we would
have heard it. If the far end of the tunnel opened,
and wind howled in and through the hollow image,
it could make those weird howls, high and low, moans
and screeches. So we followed the tunnel down, and
by using Tip’s pencil flashlight we located a lever, and
risked making the sound. But we got out.”</p>
<p>By reversing the method, he and Mr. Clark also
got in, and with the older traveler’s wisdom they
found the trick of getting into the image, and saw
that when the way was closed, the tunnel did not make
it howl. Also, from the eye-places, they made sure the
temple was deserted, and soon enough the change
of gems was complete and later, blocking the lower
door lever with a wedge of stone, they prevented pursuit
from that direction and eventually reached camp
safely. On the way Mr. Clark discarded his now useless
Eye taken from the prongs, and Roger, at last safe,
with a plane radioed for, slept and dreamed that he
was being awarded a medal “for ‘sound’ wisdom.”</p>
<p>“After all,” he said in his dream, “my deduction
was ‘sound’.”</p>
<h2 id="c19"><br>Chapter 18
<br>A LETTER ROGER HAD NOT SENT</h2>
<p>Reunion with Grover and the laboratory
staff, was, as Tip put it, “the best part of assimilating
Tibet.” He explained that he meant “taking in” the
country.</p>
<p>Roger agreed with his spirit if not with his choice
of words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>It did give him a little twinge of dismay, a slight
blow to his vanity, to discover that during his absence
Toby Smith had been put to work in the stock and
supply department. Toby Smith, who had sold them
the priceless emerald Eye of Om for a movie camera!</p>
<p>At once Roger pushed away the feeling of disappointment
and did not let it become envy. This world
and its work, he realized, had to keep moving, no
matter who dropped out. Instead of being hurt, he
dismissed his emotion by telling himself that it
showed that any person, no matter how able, could
be replaced. The important idea to have, he told himself,
was that if one made one’s self so capable as to
be missed when away, more than that could not be
done.</p>
<p>After a while he was glad he had not cherished
mean feelings, for Toby had not replaced him. He
had merely done his best. Roger, as the staff soon let
him know, had been missed for his competent way
of handling needs, keeping everything neat and available,
and being cheerful and useful under any circumstances.</p>
<p>“Am I glad you’re back!” Toby hailed him. “This
chemistry is too much for me. One day Mr. Zendt
asks for me to pack some frozen H—two—O around a
can of stuff. How’d I know the man wanted ice?”</p>
<p>“It takes study to understand the chemical symbols,”
Roger said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>“Yeh. And they have so many things that sound
safe, and they’re dynamite in disguise. Like a guy
wanted some citric acid, and I got picric acid, and
I spilled some and was swabbing it up with cotton,
and I used it to swab up something else—I forget what,
but when I was going to chuck it in the furnace, they
almost had a fit. It had turned into lyddite or some
other sort of explosive. Looked like the same cotton
to me.”</p>
<p>“I never could get them sodium calorides straight,
neither,” Potts took up the complaint against chemistry’s
“cheating” symbols. “They say it’s made out
of a gas in the ocean. And the ocean’s <i>water</i>, and here
comes gas, and they put metal, mind you—sodium—on
top of it, and it turns out to be common table salt.”</p>
<p>“It’s sodium chloride,” Roger corrected him, “not
caloride.”</p>
<p>“And they talk the craziest lingo, here,” Toby insisted.
“Mr. Ellison asked for motor brushes, so I
looked, and the only brush I could find was what we
sweep up dust with, so I took that. Was he mad!”</p>
<p>Roger’s return to his duties in charge of stock was
acceptable!</p>
<p>Grover, when the celebrations were concluded and
routine had been resumed, sat down in the private
“thinking den” as Roger called his office, and chatted.</p>
<p>“We have quite a few new interests,” he gave information.
“Mr. Ellison has perfected his speed
camera with stroboscopic lamps so strong that they
beat sunshine. He can’t use a shutter: nothing
mechanical can be made to work as fast as he wants
it to. So he uses alternate flashes of the lamp, and his
film runs so fast past the aperture that not even daylight
fogs it. Of course you know he was busy with it,
but you don’t know that he has succeeded in perfecting
it, and is studying some amazing chemical and
other operations of Nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>“Mr. Zendt has brought in rather an unusual man
for us. He was an astrologer—a man who reads
‘destiny’ in the planets by making a chart of the
zodiac for the moment a person was born. He used to
sell his ‘fortunes’ at so-much a ‘destiny’ on a Coney
Island boardwalk.</p>
<p>“Now, though, he has turned scientist.”</p>
<p>His interest, Grover explained, was in studying
in a scientific way the reactions of cells, tissues, plant
and animal life to various rays of light, heat and other
frequencies of vibration. His theory was that as the
sun awakened life in the Spring, as the moon partly
governed tides, so other planetary vibrations, reflections
and modifications of sun rays, made changes in
chemical constituents of cells; and if plants were made
up of cells, and if animals ate the plants and in their
own bodies modified and incorporated these cells,
then the rays must act on animals also; and from that,
to saying they influenced the bodies of men in some
way was not a far step.</p>
<p>With telescope, vibration-recorders, ray-filters,
lamps and spectrum devices he was carrying forward
experiments in the room next to Roger’s supply department.</p>
<p>“You will probably have to help Astrovox—he says
he is ‘the voice of the stars!’—with his apparatus,”
Grover added.</p>
<p>The most interesting point to Roger was the fact
that nothing new had occurred in their mysteries.</p>
<p>“I guess everything is settled,” Roger declared.
“With the Eye in its place, there isn’t any more danger
for Doctor Ryder, and I saw Mr. Clark exchange
the one he had for it, and even helped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>“The big jewel was in a sort of depressed place,
with prongs to hold it,” he reconstructed the event,
“and we found a way to make the prongs loosen, by
working out that the gem had to be put in, and it
was too finely cut to enable them to hammer the
prongs down, so we hunted for some secret springs,
and the Buddha image had a finger that could be
bent back, and it turned the prongs outwards, so we
substituted the real gem and then set the prongs, and
all was well.”</p>
<p>“I am not satisfied about the business, though,”
Grover stated. “In the first place, although we have
explained a good deal, and what you say about replacing
the gem is true, some of the manifestations
we experienced are sticking in the back of my head.
They seemed so—so ‘out of character’ with what
Tibetans, or gem thieves either, would have done.”</p>
<p>“But if the gem is replaced and there isn’t any more
need for the ‘manifestations,’ we won’t have any more,
and we can forget the whole thing.”</p>
<p>Grover smiled.</p>
<p>“Suppose that a series of experiments were going
forward to find a more durable resistance wire for
rheostats,” he suggested, “and the firm that commissioned
us said to drop it, how would you want to do?”</p>
<p>“The same as you always do in such a case, Grover.
Go through with it. I see your idea.”</p>
<p>The sound of the Voice of Doom, he asserted, was
explained. There really had been such a natural
phenomenon, caused by wind let into a tunnel and
making the sounds through the shape like a whistle
in the tunnel and in the Buddha image.</p>
<p>“But how did it get on the records?”</p>
<p>Roger was equally unable to answer that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>“Besides,” Grover insisted, “those priests are curious
folk. You saw the gem replaced, and to white people
that would end the need for stalking a culprit; but
they seem bent on punishing people.”</p>
<p>“‘Seem’?” Roger caught the present tense.</p>
<p>“Why, your own letter says so.”</p>
<p>“My—which letter?”</p>
<p>“The last one you wrote. It came yesterday.”</p>
<p>Grover drew from the drawer an envelope postmarked,
as Roger saw, from Bombay. They had come
on down the caravan trails, until they had met an
English airplane that had been arranged for. It had
“set down” on the plain. In that they had flown to
India, leaving their stuff to be brought along by the
next caravan and shipped home.</p>
<p>The address seemed very like his own handwriting—close
enough to have fooled Grover, evidently.</p>
<p>And yet—he had been on a packet boat, bound for
Europe, on the day shown by the postmark.</p>
<p>Quickly, startled, he opened the letter. In the same
close imitation of his exact, clear script, he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">Bombay, before sailing.</span></p>
<p>Dear Grover,</p>
<p>Well, we are homeward bound now. At the
cost of a radio and camera left in the Lamasery
of the Holiest Ones, I abandoned them. So far,
no event has come from my visit there. But of
course with the Eye of Om stolen, the Guardians
of the Eye may strike. In haste, to catch the mail,
I am,</p>
<p><span class="jr">Affectionately,</span>
<span class="jr">Your cousin.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roger looked up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>“But the Eye of Om was replaced! I helped.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you write?——”</p>
<p>“I was on a boat when that letter was posted,
Grover!”</p>
<p>He bent forward, earnest and eager.</p>
<p>“Who?—And the Eye was <i>not</i> sto——”</p>
<p>His lips closed. His face changed.</p>
<p>He remembered something.</p>
<p>It was unjust to let it mean anything. But——</p>
<p>Why had Potiphar Potts gone back to that secret
tunnel?</p>
<h2 id="c20"><br>Chapter 19
<br>DISQUIETING DEDUCTIONS</h2>
<p>Of all his loyal staff, most dependable,
sincere and trustworthy was the handy man, Potiphar
Potts. Roger knew that.</p>
<p>Honesty compelled him, all the same, to connect
the fact stated in that mystifying letter with a fact
that had not been important when it had come to him.</p>
<p>Potts, on that memorable night, holding the ponies
while Roger had gone to Clark, had, as they discovered
on their safe return, gone on into the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>When they had gotten back, to report to Doctor
Ryder the substitution for the false Eye of the one
they had brought, Potts had seemed uneasy, though
Roger had accepted the man’s own explanation.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about our idea of you leaving the
wedge in the thing that works the rock door,” he had
said, “it sounded good when we made the plan. If we
wedged the mechanical levers, we said, they couldn’t
get out that way and chase us or anything.”</p>
<p>Roger said he still thought it a sound idea.</p>
<p>“I don’t, now,” Tip had declared. “They may not
go in at the temple to see about us for days, and what
difference would it make whether the lower end is
blocked if they did come down that way? They’d go
back, mad as hornets, and we <i>would</i> be in for it!”</p>
<p>If they had left everything as before, Potts had insisted,
anyone using the lower entrance would suspect
nothing, and might not even know they had come
out that way.</p>
<p>“I’m going back and fix it the way we found it,” he
had said.</p>
<p>Loyal, honest, faithful Tip! Why, Roger wondered,
did his mind persist in telling him that Potts had
stayed away from camp a long time and why did he
associate that with the present threat?</p>
<p>Truly enough, he <i>had</i> actually seen—helped replace—that
gem. With equal sureness, the note said that
the gem was gone. It was no trick of deduction to
assume that the note had been prepared by the lamas,
soon after he had escaped. They had shown how
clever they were at pretending to be able to read his
mind, telling about the lab.</p>
<p>He recalled that he had kept a record in a booklet,
of radio conversations from his portable set in the
lamasery to the camp set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>They had specimens of his handwriting. A clever
man, forging for the purpose of conveying a threat,
perhaps planning some harm to Roger on the trip
home, had certainly, to all appearances, made the
note.</p>
<p>Well, his mind ran on, if they had been so sure
that the gem was gone, and if they had supposed that
in vanishing he and Potts had taken it, the note would
be their natural Tibetan way to account to Grover
for anything that might have happened to Roger
later.</p>
<p>Nothing had; but the note had been despatched,
with the probable knowledge that the letter, by mail,
might get a faster trip, a more direct route than the
travelers might use. It had been so.</p>
<p>Who besides Potts could have known that the
genuine gem was in its place?</p>
<p>Not the camp people; and they did not know the
secret of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Neither Clark nor Doctor Ryder had left camp for
any protracted period.</p>
<p>“But,” Roger remonstrated with his stubborn idea,
“if Tip had been tempted to take it, the Eye of Om
was available all the way there.”</p>
<p>His prodding deduction shook that off. Potts would
not have dared to try for it on the way to the temple.
But—after it was supposed to be in place, so that his
party would not know of its abstraction!——Roger
fought, but so did his insistent suspicion.</p>
<p>He decided not to tell Grover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>“I—I hesitated because—well, it came to me that
somebody else <i>could</i> have taken it, later. We got
away from that locality as fast as we could, and met
the ’plane the next day, after I had radioed our
agreed signal to a British aviation field in India to
despatch it.”</p>
<p>“We can find out something by photographing the
fingerprints on the note, and so on, with routine procedure,”
Grover dismissed Roger’s poorly explained
hesitation. “Suppose you let Tip do it.”</p>
<p>Roger agreed eagerly.</p>
<p>A fine way that would be to see Tip’s reaction.</p>
<p>Roger took him the note with Grover’s orders.</p>
<p>“Gone? The Eye—gone?”</p>
<p>Surprise seemed genuine. And Tip—Roger felt
sure—was too slow of wit to act so cleverly as to seem
innocent under this surprise.</p>
<p>“Glory-to-Grandma!” Potts gasped, “And—I—went
back——”</p>
<p>“But you wouldn’t take it!”</p>
<p>Potts made a wry face.</p>
<p>“Maybe—maybe—” he seemed to find it hard to go
on; but he forced his lips to form the sounds sent up
by his vocal chords.</p>
<p>“I declare, Rog’, if I took the Eye, I didn’t mean to.”</p>
<p>“If you took it—how could you help meaning to?”</p>
<p>“I picked up what I thought was the subterfuge——”</p>
<p>“Substitute?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thrown away by Clark, I supposed. Like
Toby done before.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>“I—uh—why—tell truth, Rog’, I—I thrown it away.
Back in Bombay. I figured it wasn’t a safe idea to keep
it, after all.”</p>
<p>So there it stood!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br>Chapter 20
<br>GHOST VOICES</h2>
<p>Roger’s mind was more at ease. He had
seen Mr. Clark pocket the gem for which they substituted
their Eye of Aum. Outside the rock door as
they emerged from the fissure leading down from the
temple, he had seen the man’s hand pull it from his
pocket and fling it away.</p>
<p>“That’s no good,” the jeweler helping Doctor
Ryder had chuckled.</p>
<p>Definitely, in Roger’s mind, Potts had found that
cast-away imitation. He had not gone back through
the tunnel!</p>
<p>“Exonerated,” he said, cheerfully, and they
brushed a finely pulverized compound over the note,
seeking to bring into relief the possible finger-prints
thereon. Several faint smudges showed, and Potts
made a photographic exposure, also using chemicals,
with other takes, to bring up possible marks, erasures
and so on.</p>
<p>Roger left him at his work, at a call from Astrovox,
the scientific student of planetary vibration who had
been a side-show astrologer.</p>
<p>Joining the plump, bald-headed little man, close
to sixty, whose deep-set, shaggy-browed blue eyes
twinkled with inward cheerfulness, Roger helped him
rig up his seemingly crazy idea of a vibra-spectra-telegraph-o-scope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>That was what Roger mentally named it. The man
wanted to catch the possible vibrations of higher and
lower frequencies than light range. He also wished
the various colors showing in a star ray to tell whatever
spectrum bands it might contain. Besides, he
had to hold this apparatus trained on a desired planet
or star, by use of a mechanical movement that enabled
him, through a transit’s hairlike “sight” to follow a
star as the earth revolved. Furthermore, he wished
photographs and a sort of seismographic tape recording
of vibration frequencies.</p>
<p>The nine-power telescope he had to be satisfied
with was set up to poke its outer lens up through the
skylight over the supply room.</p>
<p>All around the smaller, adjoining, partitioned place
formerly made notable because of the vanishing rats
and the strange voices, he had cages of mice, squirrels
and rabbits, under rays from electrical, and other
forms of vibration. In hot-house “frames” or small
beds under glass he kept living plants, with color-filters
straining the light playing on them, to test reaction to
heat, light and color.</p>
<p>One bed, under a brownish glass, Roger noticed,
had thin, stringy, sickly vegetation in it. In one under
a short-wave irradiation treatment, plants thrived.</p>
<p>In tiny flat, glass-protected trays, specimens of cell-cultures
in tubes, and sections of living plant tissue
were being exposed.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll have to clean out the far corner,”
Astrovox suggested, “I dumped all the wrappings
there. Might start a fire.”</p>
<p>Approaching to help, he finished his sentence with
a chuckle.</p>
<p>Roger nodded, and gathered up the papers, making
a fine rattle in the process.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>A glow-bulb lighted in the interconnected tell-tale
panel as a small bell rang. Roger, glancing at the panel,
saw that the summons was from the electrical division
downstairs. He went to the head of the steps.</p>
<p>“Want me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered the voice of Professor Millman,
electrical engineer. “We’re going to make a flat-table
recording. I don’t just see where we get power for the
motor from.”</p>
<p>“Right down close under the recording machine
table,” Roger called down his information. “You’ll
see an outlet set into the floor.”</p>
<p>“Oh—thanks, yes. I see.”</p>
<p>Roger went back to help Astrovox.</p>
<p>“Can’t risk it, with all the chemicals, and combustible
stuff,” he answered the former phrases of the
old astrologer.</p>
<p>“Not with Neptune, the planet, in opposition to
Saturn and with Mars opposing Uranus,” the old man
chuckled.</p>
<p>Roger looked as if he did not see the point.</p>
<p>“In our belief that the planetary positions influence
chemical reactions—and all life is chemical, or, at least
electro-chemical,” he was told, “we use the known
planets as symbols for forces of nature. Saturn, you
might say, stands for cohesion—or, better, say for
crystallization, because Saturn makes gravity possible,
makes density in our earth by cohering its quintrillions
of atoms.</p>
<p>“Mars we could say is a symbol for the combustion
engendered by fire, the same as Uranus is, in a way,
a symbol of explosiveness, and Neptune seems to
represent a sort of disintegration, diffusion and slow
separation of atoms, not by explosion but by attrition.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>To Roger it was all pretty much like Egyptian
hieroglyphics but the man seemed to be talking what
he considered sensible phrases.</p>
<p>“Let us say that we place a pellet of putty between
two machines, one engendering a force like repulsion;
the other giving quick, and very high-frequency stabs
of current toward the other. The answer might be
that the pellet would explode or fly into its atoms.</p>
<p>“But,” the old man went on, “The force of cohesion
would hold our earth together in such an experiment,
though the volume or size of the tiny pellet
would be too little for it to act on sufficiently to keep
the form together. That, in a way, is what so many
people misunderstand when they talk about astrology.
Properly used, correctly interpreted, it enables us to
understand our reactions—emotions——”</p>
<p>Roger was in the next room, loading the papers on
the dumb-waiter to send to the cellar. As he came
back, gathering up more, Astrovox, as if he had ranted
along on his favorite topic without ceasing, said:</p>
<p>“—fire.” He stood up. “Where were you? I was
telling about Mars and Uranus exploding things and
starting fires.”</p>
<p>“I have to work.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s so. Well, this is your last load.”</p>
<p>Roger gathered the great heap of heavy wrapping
paper, and left him shifting one bed of plants from
under a deep ruby glass so that they would be exposed
to a pale green color filtration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Going down to remove the papers from the dumb-waiter,
Roger saw Mr. Millman finish recording the
multitude of gyrations of a sparking motor shaft
which Mr. Ellison was photographing with his camera.</p>
<p>“We are going to count the sparks,” he told Roger,
“just to check up on the speedometer attached to the
flywheel, which Millman says is off-count by hundreds
of revolutions to the minute.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take the record up and have it made ready
for a slow playback. I’m going up anyway.”</p>
<p>He turned it over to Potts as the note had been
thoroughly revealed in all his exposures, and had
shown no identifying finger-marks.</p>
<p>Roger went back to Astrovox, and became deeply
interested in the latter’s plans for night study of the
spectra of stars.</p>
<p>“I wonder if your cousin would arrange for one of
his men to stay part of the night with me, to take
down my data?”</p>
<p>“We can set up a dictograph, and let you talk it
onto a record.”</p>
<p>“That would do.”</p>
<p>“Or—we could mike down from here to one of our
magazine-recorders that puts a new record on the
spindle of the turntable when the other has been used
up. That would run you for hours, if you’d stop it in
between dictating periods.”</p>
<p>The thing was arranged and Roger, before going
home, demonstrated the mechanism and was sure the
old man understood its operation.</p>
<p>Because of the threat implied in the forged note,
Grover gave Potts instructions to transfer from Doctor
Ryder’s rooms the mechanisms he wanted to have installed
for Roger’s protection. With a changed switch
operated only from inside the room, the former ease
of operation by others, he thought, was eliminated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Roger, tired by celebration and resuming work, retired
early, being sure that his switch was set, his room
theoretically a sealed place.</p>
<p>Sleep came. Rest, though was disturbed by weird
dreams.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he knew, dreams had outward causes
stimulating them, as happens if a draft on exposed
limbs makes one dream of riding on a sled and falling
into a snow bank in howling wind.</p>
<p>His dream of a burglar, as he awakened and looked
rather fearfully around, made him grin, though.</p>
<p>That room had been sealed by no one other than
himself!</p>
<p>But a low, humming whine made him certain that
machinery was in operation—the hum of the recorder
motor. He located it. Proved it. Shutting off the
device in case some jar had started it, he went to test
his door. But he recalled that the motor still ran.</p>
<p>To his dismay, the door was not merely unsealed.
It stood ajar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, startlingly, from behind him, his table
radio spoke, in a thin, strained, bizarre cry.</p>
<p>“Fire!” and he heard, faintly, the crackle of
flames.</p>
<p>Then an uncanny silence, dreadful by contrast,
came.</p>
<p>He spied around the hall. It, too, was silent. He
tiptoed down to the library, telephoned the laboratory,
and got no reply.</p>
<p>Once again—something was wrong—in two places!
He must go to that laboratory. Grover should have
answered—or Tip—or Astrovox!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br>Chapter 21
<br>TRAGEDY!</h2>
<p>Half way to the laboratory, Roger pulled up
in his stride, half ready to laugh at his stupidity. A
joke? Of course.</p>
<p>Potts, on Grover’s instructions, had made the room
installation. To “get back” at his chum for the suspicion
about the Eye of Om, the handy man could
have made that “Fire” cry on a record, could have
known how to break a light beam. He, alone, could
have prepared the impregnable place so that it might
be entered, it seemed to Roger.</p>
<p>A recording, he also knew, was the other end of a
reproduction. To print a sound-track on a disk, one
used a microphone; its diaphragm sent vibrations
through a selenium cell and other apparatus until it
actuated the recording diamond: to play it back, the
process was reversed.</p>
<p>The use of the diamond, instead of a smooth reproducing
needle on a hardened surface, <i>could</i> cause
that high, thin, scratchy voice.</p>
<p>“But Cousin Grover was not at home,” his mind
prompted, “and the door was open, and the light
would not work. The lab. telephone was dead, too!”</p>
<p>Perhaps Potts had tried a joke; but it seemed as if
it had turned into a warning, a summons; because,
when he reached the building, the door was not
secured, no protective beam had been set; and in the
main office, he smelt the sharp, acrid odor of burned
powder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>A gun must have been fired in there, he reasoned.
By whom? For what? His mind raced to terrifying
impressions. Explosion! Shot!</p>
<p>The place was jet-dark. As he investigated he decided
that odor was strongest close to the interviewing
desk, pungent enough to choke him.</p>
<p>Into the larger main room he made his way, finding
the powder odor was less strong beyond the main
office as he switched on lights and took broader observations.</p>
<p>On the large desk used for interviewing visitors he
saw that the framed photograph of his aunt, Grover’s
sister, had been knocked down, and lay on its face.
An inkwell, in a pool of black on the floor beyond
the desk, was shattered into large fragments, and tiny
bits.</p>
<p>He stood still, and shouted.</p>
<p>“Tip! Tip! Potiphar Potts! Tip!”</p>
<p>Getting no answer he raced across the chemical section
to the man’s small quarters.</p>
<p>The bed had been used, its covers had been thrown
back, as if in haste.</p>
<p>No Potts, as once before, stood tied to the bedpost.</p>
<p>The room was empty.</p>
<p>He shouted for Astrovox, feeling a strange desire to
laugh at the sound of the name when it was shouted.
“Astro—<i>vox!</i>”</p>
<p>He called for his cousin.</p>
<p>Then, with every light going, in spite of queer
terrors, Roger made a thorough search of the lower
floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>That brought no result. Nothing seemed to have
been moved and as far as he could tell the safe was all
right and the device that now made it sink into a
channel in the cellar, so that a steel plate could slide
over and make it impregnable, seemed to be in working
condition.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, forcing his dragging feet, he crept upstairs.</p>
<p>No one was in sight. The old star-gazer was gone
also!</p>
<p>Roger stood, uncertainly glancing around.</p>
<p>Had this been tragedy? A shot? At whom? Where
were the rest?</p>
<p>Of a sudden the threat in the note became his uppermost
thought. Had someone—or something!—drawn
the rest away, and lured <i>him</i> there?</p>
<p>Roger, nervously, glanced around him.</p>
<p>The innocent squirrels and rabbits and mice curled
up in their temporary respite from the ray-baths. The
machines set up earlier hummed quietly, recording,
slowly moving the telescope, casting spectra of a star’s
light in bands of greenish-brown, yellow and indigo
on a flat paper-table. Everything seemed innocent
enough.</p>
<p>But where, he mused, had the scientific star-student
gone to?</p>
<p>Where was Cousin Grover? And, above all, where
was Tip, one out of all of them who ought to have
been on duty, if not asleep.</p>
<p>Roger glanced up at the clock.</p>
<p>Not five, but two, was the hour toward which the
smaller hand was dropping as the minute hand
marked the quarter-of.</p>
<p>It <i>had</i> been “fire” that his record had screeched at
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>But there was no fire here!</p>
<p>Roger began to feel somewhat like a person flying
in an airplane for the first time, seeing everything else
swinging beneath him, and feeling no movement
himself.</p>
<p>It made him sickish.</p>
<p>“Am I out of my mind?” he asked himself. “Is this
a dream?”</p>
<p>There must be some loose end of this amazing situation
that he could get hold of, to reel in the story and
steady his rapidly failing sense of reality.</p>
<p>The sound-camera! It had been running perhaps,
till its roll of non-flam film was done. It might tell
him something.</p>
<p>Feverishly he got pyro, acid and the sodas into the
developing water. He did not stop even for distilled
water but took tap fluid.</p>
<p>He immersed the hurriedly rubber-wrapped celluloid.</p>
<p>As it stayed the required fifteen or eighteen minutes,
he went over the lab. again, finding no more than before.</p>
<p>He took out the roll, dipped it into hypo-acid fixing
solution, and impatiently watched its opaque yellowish
high-lights slowly dissolve and lose the un-needed
silver salts, to clear into transparency as grays and
blacks became more evident.</p>
<p>Hastily washing the film, he unreeled an end, held
it up under a light, to see if the sound-track at one
side carried any shadows.</p>
<p>There was a recording!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Feverishly, forgetting his terrors, he raced to the
projector in the screening room. Carefully in spite of
haste he threaded the wet “stock” over the sprocket,
down through the film gate, over another sprocket and
clipped the end to the take-up reel. He snapped on the
light.</p>
<p>At proper speed, and sorry that he must harm the
wet emulsion, but eager to hear its story, he ran his
find.</p>
<p>The picture was that of the upper room, narrowed
down onto the various activities of the old star-reader.
The first was a take of his rabbits as they scampered
about under a change of ray-lamps.</p>
<p>Then came the brief time-exposures of tabulations,
preserved thus.</p>
<p>But nowhere, except for natural sounds, the squeak
of mice when a movement of a high-frequency ray cast
it upon them—the chatter of the squirrels—ordinary
lab. sounds of moving feet and muttered words by
the old man, did Roger hear what he sought—enlightenment.</p>
<p>He was near the end of the reel, about to give up,
when his ears sent a message that snapped his muscles
into taut tension.</p>
<p>“Hear me. I am The Voice of Doom!”</p>
<p>He saw, in the picture, the astrologer wheel and
stare. He saw him turn and run out of view.</p>
<p>Then, with scream subsiding in moan, the Voice of
Doom repeated its earlier moaning, ending in the
grind and sudden cessation.</p>
<p>The film, unnoticed, ran out of the gate, and the
magazine clicked to the slap of its still revolving free
end.</p>
<p>Roger let it run on. He had discovered a strange
clue!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Once coming from a deserted room, and once
spoken on a record that had been considered blank,
and then a third time from a record that had been
set to catch sound in Doctor Ryder’s home, had come
that same Voice of Doom, the identical moaning and
grating.</p>
<p>In reality, in the heart of Tibet, Roger had also
heard that sound.</p>
<p>And in Tibet, the rock that cut off the sound had
made no noise as its counterweight allowed it to shut
out the wind that made the moans as it howled across
the Himalayas and up through tunnel and whistling
Buddha’s hollow cavities!</p>
<p>Even as he made his startling realization, Roger
heard a bell.</p>
<p>It came from the office telephone.</p>
<p>He dashed down the stairs, cutting out the projector
as he ran by.</p>
<p>“Hello!——”</p>
<p>A voice came, thin with distance.</p>
<p>“That you, Rog’?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Tip—at the lab. Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Hunting Grover.”</p>
<p>“Where did he go?”</p>
<p>“To find the star-man.”</p>
<p>“And why did he leave?”</p>
<p>“He was—took!”</p>
<p>“Do you—does Grover—think he was—was in
danger—hurt?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know. You stay there. I’ll keep in touch.”</p>
<p>The connection broke off sharply.</p>
<p>From behind him a voice addressed Roger.</p>
<p>“Follow me—and be silent!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>There stood the Lama from the Tibetan lamasery.
Two others, also.</p>
<p>Wordless, helpless, Roger moved: they closed in behind
him.</p>
<p>The night swallowed the quartet.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><br>Chapter 22
<br>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EYE OF OM</h2>
<p>They allowed Roger to lock up the laboratory;
but he had not been permitted to re-set the rays or
other protective devices.</p>
<p>That did not concern him overmuch. Roger knew
that the safe protection was a separate circuit from
those he had cut out when he had unfastened the door
on arriving. Besides, he told himself triumphantly,
he had recalled the camera fixed in the small decorative
panel over the interviewing chair, so arranged
that it would photograph a short time exposure of the
office and of anyone there. Used to make records of
visitors on their arrival with new propositions, as well
as a night protection and recorder for the office, it had
been operated by Roger, with good presence of mind,
when his captors had entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Whoever came there later would be able to develop
the picture he had left recorded. He had not used the
continuous mechanism, but his one photograph would
reveal him and the Tibetan trio.</p>
<p>A taxi, taking them to some unknown district, was
further cause for triumph. The taxi, from a nearby
stand, had been used before by the laboratory people.
Its driver knew him, though he gave no sign.</p>
<p>Roger meant to act in such a way that the man, discharging
his fare and being paid, would suspect something
wrong, return to the laboratory, or consult the
police.</p>
<p>At a quiet, small hotel, the machine stopped. Roger,
with hands clasped behind his back, made gestures;
waggling his fingers to attract the taximan’s notice,
then touching himself and clenching his fist.</p>
<p>“Thanks, feller,” the man took his fare, and added,
to show Roger he was “wise,” “That science place
brought me a good tip. Guess I better go back and see
about more good fares there.”</p>
<p>Instead of causing a commotion as they passed the
drowsy office clerk, Roger let things stand as they
were, and was taken up to a quiet suite where the two
guards placidly watched him while the Lama telephoned
from another room.</p>
<p>After a while, returning, the man ushered in—Grover.</p>
<p>“How did you come here?” cried Roger.</p>
<p>“So they got you.”</p>
<p>“But you shouldn’t——”</p>
<p>“I didn’t exactly walk into a trap, Roger. The Chief
of Police knows where I came in answer to a note
handed me while I was trying to trace Astrovox. If I
do not telephone within an hour, somebody will come
to see what’s what.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>He explained what Roger had not known (after
hearing the strange events of the opened door, the
screeching table radio and seeing the smoke-filled
office).</p>
<p>“I stayed to watch Astrovox make spectra-graphs of
color bands,” Grover explained, “sending Tip here
to be on guard. An excited call seeming to come from
him brought me to the house just as a note he got
started him to the laboratory. We passed, not knowing.
I found your safeguards apparently working, and returned.
Potts was trying to reassure the star-gazer who
had heard that Voice of Doom. But Tip was frightened
also. We sent the astrologer to lie down on Tip’s bed,
while we investigated. He came back to us after a few
minutes saying he was too much upset to stay there.
He thought the Tibetans had involved him in some
manner.”</p>
<p>Tip, it appeared, had agreed to go along to be sure
the man got going and reached home safely.</p>
<p>Tip had bidden him wait, in the chemical section,
while he went to his own room to get a weapon for
safety’s sake.</p>
<p>“I suppose he must have heard something or started
into the office, Roger. At any rate, suddenly, we heard
the shot. I was down those stairs in a bound, and beat
Tip by ten feet getting in where the smoke still hung
in the air.”</p>
<p>“It was strong when I got there.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>“But the office was empty. I told Potts to stay, and
ran out. A man, strolling, had stopped. I asked if he
had seen a man go out and he pointed up the street,
and like most of those night-prowlers he tried to avoid
the light and hid his face with his hat brim. He was
fairly short and stoutish, but it wasn’t Astrovox. I ran,
and thought I saw the star-gazer further along; but it
was not our man. I suppose Tip, worried, came to look
for me. You say the wires were silent.”</p>
<p>He was stopped by the arrival of Tip who had been
lured, as he had, by a note delivered by a boy; and
almost on his heels came Clark and Doctor Ryder,
fuming and puzzled and anxious.</p>
<p>They were given no time to exchange words. The
Lama spoke:</p>
<p>“We want the sacred relic, the Eye of Om.”</p>
<p>“It is in the Buddha’s head,” Roger said earnestly,
“I saw this man put it there.”</p>
<p>“He tells the truth,” Clark declared.</p>
<p>“To prove it,” Roger hurried on, “the prongs work
open when you press the Buddha’s third left finger
straight in and then back.”</p>
<p>The Lama stared.</p>
<p>“And to furthermore prove it and make it inadmissible——”</p>
<p>“Incontrovertible, Tip means,” said Grover.</p>
<p>“—I went back, later, to take wedges out of the lower
lever, after we beat your trick tunnel, and picked up
the Imitation that Rog’ tells me Mister Clark throwed
away. I carried it as far as Bombay, and figured it
wasn’t worth anything anyhow, so I left it in the waste-basket
in the hotel room.”</p>
<p>The Tibetan lama stared at him sternly.</p>
<p>“That was but an imitation. It was the one taken
<i>out</i> that I demand, from the boy who must know
where it is.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>“But—I tell you!” Roger was earnest, “I saw Mister
Clark exchange the false one. And he dropped the
one taken out into his coat, and when we got out of
the tunnel and closed the rock, he threw it away,
saying it wasn’t any use. Tip, here, found that!”</p>
<p>The lama shook his head.</p>
<p>“The Eye of Om is not in its socket!”</p>
<p>A sudden thought came to Mr. Clark. With a cry of
dismay he told them his startling idea.</p>
<p>“It must be that in the excitement, meaning to exchange
the imitation for the real—to put back what
rightfully belonged there and protect my friend, Doctor
Ryder, I must have mixed the gems, and instead
of replacing the false one with the real one, I must
have put the false one back, and really threw away the
true Eye.”</p>
<p>“Then—I throwed it away in Bombay.”</p>
<p>The lama considered the statement made by Tip.</p>
<p>“If any of you speak falsely,” he said, slowly, “you
who speak so shall hear the Voice of Doom and shall
feel the Wrath of the Hand of Doom.”</p>
<p>With that threat he bade them depart.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><br>Chapter 23
<br>THE ACID TEST</h2>
<p>“Oh, no you don’t,” Grover spoke for the
first time during the interview, “there is a matter of
a vanished scientific student of the stars, a shot prior
to his disappearance, and other things.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The lama turned toward his aides.</p>
<p>Grover, as Roger and Potts sidled close, smiled.</p>
<p>“An hour and ten minutes has elapsed since I arrived,”
he remarked, pleasantly, cool and slightly triumphant,
“I would not be surprised—yes, there they
are.”</p>
<p>The police car, sent by the Chief of Police, brought
two patrolmen and as a frightened clerk ushered them
in, the lama shrugged.</p>
<p>Captor became prisoner, and with his pair of native
aides, the lama was taken to the laboratory by the
interested officers.</p>
<p>There, as Grover’s car discharged its crowd of
former captives, Roger was able to reward the taximan
who had faithfully read his signal and who was waiting
with a patrolman to be assured that all was well
there before going to the address the taximan had
noted.</p>
<p>“I knew this joint was lucky,” the taximan chuckled,
pocketing a pleasing tip, “Hope all stays well—but if
it doesn’t—I’ll be handy.”</p>
<p>While Tip was sent to develop camera films from
various devices which had been set off during the exciting
developments, Roger was busy assembling the
ingredients for an experiment which Grover meant
to conduct, in order to learn which of the people there
had held the pistol that might have harmed old Astrovox—that
had certainly been fired in the office.</p>
<p>To their surprise as they brought together the necessary
chemicals and Roger got out plaster-of-Paris from
his stock-room, with highly refined paraffin, the star
electrician, Ellison, arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>“What brings you here at five in the morning?”
Grover stared at him with a degree of suspicion.</p>
<p>“I have been working out theories about our queer
situation,” declared the electrical specialist, “I could
not sleep, because Clark had told me all about his
experiences with Roger in Tibet, and I was of the
opinion that Roger might be in danger.”</p>
<p>“I told him how they had captured you,” Clark said,
as Roger recalled that they had worked together in
India on power-construction, so that there was nothing
to fix suspicion on them in thus having a reunion
after Clark’s return.</p>
<p>“I went to your home,” he told Grover. “Roger’s
room was open, his aunt was greatly disturbed because
you were also absent.”</p>
<p>Naturally, he had come to the laboratory.</p>
<p>While he softened the paraffin, Roger told him their
adventures.</p>
<p>“Now,” Grover told the absorbed patrolmen, and a
detective who had come, by Police Chief’s order, from
Headquarters, “here is a dodge that some police departments
have tried, and it will interest you.”</p>
<p>Roger assembled on the interviewing desk his heater
for a great lot of the wax, held in a crucible over the
electric stove. In a large glass container he mixed, according
to a formula dictated by Grover, nitric acid
and other chemicals, which discretion suggests should
not be mentioned here.</p>
<p>“The purpose of this experiment,” Grover said, “is
to learn which hand, if any among us, held, and discharged
the weapon. That seems to be the simplest
way to narrow down investigation. Once we know our
culprit, he must reveal where Astrovox is, what happened.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The very modern experiment, the police saw, was
based on the fact that the charges used in modern
pistol projectiles form, during combustion, gases
which leave marks on any hand discharging the bullet.</p>
<p>Grover explained his procedure.</p>
<p>“The gases blow back sufficiently to mark the hand,”
he stated. “If our test is made within five days after
such an occurrence, the test will reveal it.</p>
<p>“I will be first. Roger will take the wax, properly
softened, and at a temperature around one hundred
and fifteen degrees, Fahrenheit, not hot enough to
scald, will pour it over and will mould it around my
hand.”</p>
<p>Roger carried out the action as it was described.</p>
<p>“The paraffin, now cooling, at a point where it is
hard enough to hold its shape, is taken off.”</p>
<p>This, also, Roger carried out carefully, securing a
sort of cast with the shape of the hand moulded inside
it.</p>
<p>This, as Grover talked, Roger carefully placed in
the chemical solution, and they all watched in absorbed
attentiveness.</p>
<p>“If my hand has discharged any weapon or in any
other way has gotten the peculiar gases of powder
combustion on it, within the past five days, the acid
and solution will bring up the stains as bluish discolorations
on the wax.”</p>
<p>No such spots appeared.</p>
<p>Although a tedious operation to carry out for the
Tibetan trio, and then, by their own insistence, for
Doctor Ryder, Clark, Tip and Roger, the results in
each case held them in suspense until there was clear
exoneration of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>“But Ellison hasn’t submitted yet,” said Tip, suddenly.</p>
<p>“Because I have handled chemicals in my work that
may come out in the reaction,” Ellison frowned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though he declared that his work had
brought out the stains that showed as small blue spots
and smears within his mould, everybody felt that he
ought to know what he declared he did not—where
was the star-scientist?</p>
<h2 id="c25"><br>Chapter 24
<br>AN IMPOSSIBLE CAMERA “SHOT”</h2>
<p>Grilled by the detective and the policemen,
Ellison stubbornly protested his ignorance of the
whereabouts of the former astrologer.</p>
<p>He could not establish an “alibi” further than his
recent call at Grover’s home which the excited sister
of the laboratory head was eager to verify.</p>
<p>Roger, finally, decided that there was one sure and
final word to be said by chemistry. If, as Ellison insisted,
other chemicals than actual burning gas caused
the inside of the paraffin moulds to discolor, the special
tests for the chemicals he might name would say if
Ellison was truthful or not—a sort of chemical “Lie
Detector,” Roger confided to Potts as they prepared
for the experiments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>To their amazement, Ellison was proved honest.
The tests gave a reaction for the very chemical he
named.</p>
<p>The Tibetans, of course, had to be released. They
were warned, and departed.</p>
<p>With the experiments done, the materials removed
and no gain, Tip brought up the curious situation
revealed by developing the office camera film and
others.</p>
<p>“Here is the picture that Roger said he had it take,”
Tip displayed, to the group assembled in the screening
room, one “frame” of the non-flam film.</p>
<p>There were the Three, the Tibetan group, confronting
Roger as his hand, on the edge of the desk,
disclosed his clever use of the “take” to leave evidence
of his capture.</p>
<p>“Now—study this out if you can!” Tip called out
from behind the projector.</p>
<p>He shifted the sprocket-turning handle to bring up
the next picture.</p>
<p>“That’s the office, what you can see through the
smoke,” Tip declared, “and the smoke comes from
behind the desk, and so of course the man standing
there has got his back to the lens, and all we have got
to go on is his coat and his hair.”</p>
<p>He readjusted the “framing handle” to bring the
picture into even more exact alignment with the aperture
plate of his projector, so that on the screen every
part showed.</p>
<p>“Now, study that! There is old Astrovox, scared
looking. He is facing the big smudge of smoke from
the pistol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>“But what gets me,” Tip finished, “is that the whole
big puff of smoke is still hanging in the air, and the
man facing it is just hit—or else his face is contractuated——”</p>
<p>“Contorted,” cried Roger. “Skip big words and say
your say.”</p>
<p>“Or else his face is contorted by being awful sure
he has been hit.”</p>
<p>He focused more sharply.</p>
<p>“You can see him clear enough to know Astrovox
didn’t fire no gun. The smoke is between him and the
guy with his back to us. But—just look. His hands rest
both of ’em on the desk edge. That’s how he hit against
the button in the desk edge that snapped his picture.</p>
<p>“Now—where is any gun?”</p>
<p>“He couldn’t have dropped it, and have gotten his
hands back onto the desk before the smoke puff would
have begun to shift,” exclaimed a policeman. “Look.”
He drew out his service weapon, aimed into a corner
where his bullet would show little and its mark could
be wiped out with putty and paint, and fired.</p>
<p>The smoke, with his own movements, revealed disturbances
almost as it left the mouth of his weapon;
and before he could drop it, the smoke shifted. More!
The pistol, falling, cut a swath in the pall.</p>
<p>“There’s no gun. And no one is hiding. The smoke
is in front of that man and between him and Astrovox,”
the detective agreed.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,” Potts exclaimed, “A camera can’t
take a picture of a shot and leave out the gun.”</p>
<p>“Chemicals,” prompted Grover, “could make the
smudge.”</p>
<p>“Then how about this?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Potts had another film spliced onto the first one.
He reeled it in at regular motion picture speed, and
out of the speakers came the strange and abrupt recording
of a loud, sharp, detonating sound, as near
to the discharge of a pistol as any of them had heard.</p>
<p>Taken away by the ventilating system, the smoke
of the police shot was out of the way, the screen was
clear to all, and they saw that the camera had recorded
light from the direction of the office, an abrupt flash.
With it, the detonation.</p>
<p>“Kangaroos and apes dancin’ on a film where none
could be,” Tip summed up, baffled, “and now—a gunshot
where the camera shows us there can’t be any
gun.”</p>
<p>Even Grover, usually calm, looked disconcerted,
and yet a little bit excited.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” he declared, and turned to Roger, “but
here is one more ‘sound’ to add to your list. And I
feel sure that out of that list, either as it is, or when
you complete it up to date, will come the hint that will
enable me to clear up everything.”</p>
<p>Over-confidence?</p>
<p>Roger hoped not.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><br>Chapter 25
<br>SCORE ONE FOR THE MYSTERY WIZARD</h2>
<p>Grover stood up. His eyes were bright with
some inner fire as he walked forward, turned and faced
his attentive audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>“You have overlooked a number of points shown in
that picture,” began the laboratory Chief.</p>
<p>“In the first place, assuming that a shot had been
fired, you see that there is no inkwell on the desk and
that the picture of my sister has been knocked over or
has fallen over.”</p>
<p>“You mean, the shot was fired from another direction,
and not by the man whose back is turned.” The
detective spoke.</p>
<p>“Can you see any other explanation for the disclosed
conditions?”</p>
<p>“The inkwell was in a pool of ink on the floor when
I got here,” said Roger, excitedly, “and the picture
of Auntie was on its face.”</p>
<p>“The shot was fired from a gun behind Astrovox,”
said Potts.</p>
<p>“No,” Grover corrected him, “because the smoke is
closer to the other man than to Astrovox. In fact, it is
up around his side of the desk.”</p>
<p>“But his hands——”</p>
<p>“He did not fire a gun,” answering the policeman,
Grover clarified his deduction. “But—think! Where
in that office could a man be, and not have the camera
register his presence? Granting that he could lift the
gun above his head and still keep it out of sight of the
lens.”</p>
<p>“Can’t be,” cried Potts.</p>
<p>“Can.” Roger almost shouted in his interest. “He
could crouch on the side of the desk <i>toward</i> Astrovox,
and shoot at the man behind the desk, and the puff
of smoke would shoot out toward the man.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Grover agreed, but suddenly he jumped as
his nerves reacted to a new idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>“But—wait! A gun at that angle could not discharge
a bullet to smash the inkwell.”</p>
<p>They stared, and then admitted his sensible reasoning.</p>
<p>“Back where we started,” growled the detective.</p>
<p>“It is a ‘composite’ picture, perhaps,” said Ellison.
“You know—one part taken at one time, another exposed
elsewhere, or at another time.”</p>
<p>“Possible, not probable,” volunteered Doctor Ryder.
“In double-exposures, wouldn’t the smoke be—I
don’t know the phrase——”</p>
<p>“Not in register,” cried Roger. “It can’t be double- or
triple-exposed. Everything is all together, the smoke
over the desk, and the men properly distinct.”</p>
<p>“It just must be some trick picture,” argued Ellison.</p>
<p>“Did no other camera operated by some one having
entered—they all ran for three minutes—did none have
the shot recorded?” asked Grover, and Potts displayed
films.</p>
<p>“They all did. Some fainter.”</p>
<p>“We can test for distance, with a sort of applause-volume
machine,” suggested Ellison.</p>
<p>“But, first, let us come back to Astrovox,” urged
Grover. “He is gone. Why? How? Did the man at the
desk take him?” He turned and scanned the groups
intently. “The fellow with his back turned has your
shoulders, Ellison.”</p>
<p>“But not my suit.”</p>
<p>“You could change suits.”</p>
<p>“You certainly want to ‘pin it on’ me.”</p>
<p>“We want to find Astrovox.”</p>
<p>The electrician made a grunting sound.</p>
<p>“I can’t help, there.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Grover, though, did not pursue the argument. He
seemed buried in meditation.</p>
<p>“Here is something we overlooked, too.” He spoke
slowly, searching for hints in his own inner processes.
“Look at the smoke. The light in that office, according
to the picture itself, was the overhead dome. Now,
with that small actinic quality, the camera with a
daylight type of film, would have recorded only in
exposures amounting to at least a second. It <i>would</i>
have been possible for the man to have fired, dropped
the gun. Possibly if he snatched it up and let it drop—no.
The flash would have been filmed! Let’s work at
this!</p>
<p>“Notice—the edge of the smoke is duller, less distinct,
but the lower part of the smudge is thick and
dense, as though—the smoke had been settling during
the exposure.”</p>
<p>“So, where does that get us?” asked Ellison.</p>
<p>“To this. The man at the desk is extremely clear.
Astrovox is less distinct, recognizable but still a trifle
hazy. We assumed it was the smoke. It isn’t. It is the
fact that when he heard the shot, Astrovox was just
outside the doorway. He ran in, too fast to be recorded
in that brief exposure that caught him just pausing.
Now, that accounts for the other camera’s proving that
a shot was fired.</p>
<p>“It was fired at the man behind the desk. Then
Astrovox ran in, and he had to be there an appreciable
fraction of time to be registered. He got in just
about half-way through the exposure, and his pause
imprinted his image just before the shutter closed.
Now—what would have been his natural, subsequent
procedure?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Frightened by the past sound of the Voice of Doom,
he went on, the man had been about to leave, and was
merely waiting for Potts.</p>
<p>“He ran in, saw the source of the shot, saw the man
crouched under the desk after his shot had hit the
inkwell instead of his mark, the other man. He turned,
and ran. But the man who had crouched would know
that he had been seen, must think the old man ran
for help.</p>
<p>“He went after Astrovox—to silence him!”</p>
<p>The auditors, spellbound by his train of reasoning,
had literally hung in suspense.</p>
<p>“The man evidently had a gun,” Grover went ahead
with his thought, speaking slowly. “He took only a
fraction of time to leap up and pursue. He would not
have let Astrovox get far.</p>
<p>“Let us search the areaways nearby,” he concluded,
seriously.</p>
<p>They scattered, the police officers and the detective
organizing the search.</p>
<p>It was “score one” for the Mystery Wizard.</p>
<p>Sound had been his deductions, as events showed.</p>
<p>Only in one point had he been mistaken.</p>
<p>The old astrologer had not been shot. His limp
body, brought in from its place within an old packing
case across the street, showed that not the muzzle had
been used to make of him a target. The butt of the
weapon had left its mark.</p>
<p>“Adrenalin—we may bring him back!” shouted Doctor
Ryder.</p>
<p>Potts raced for the nearest drug-store, while the
police called an ambulance.</p>
<p>“Let me work with him,” pleaded Doctor Ryder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>But Tip did not secure the heart stimulant, so
seldom, and yet occasionally able to restore heart action
after it has seemed to cease.</p>
<p>They took him away, and Grover, stunned at his
own accurate deductions, hopeful that he had reasoned
so accurately in time, went too.</p>
<p>The rest hung around the telephone.</p>
<p>At last came word.</p>
<p>“He will probably live!”</p>
<h2 id="c27"><br>Chapter 26
<br>ROGER LISTS HIS CLUES</h2>
<p>During Grover’s absence at the hospital, the
staff began to arrive. Until the secretary should come
to handle the switchboard Doctor Ryder volunteered
to be monitor on calls, being extremely anxious concerning
the condition of the assaulted star-reader, as
were the rest.</p>
<p>Roger, as Toby Smith with a heavy suitcase arrived,
turned over the few requisitions for stock to his willing
assistant.</p>
<p>He wanted very much to fill up the list of sounds
he had begun in the office before going to Tibet.</p>
<p>“Suits me fine,” Toby agreed, “I got a lot more of
Doctor Ryder’s what he calls compounds, that he is
going to use to medicate the rats he is going to replace.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The members of the staff, trained under the
phlegmatic, scientific methods of Grover, took very
little time to discuss conditions. The routine work of
scientific research had to proceed. They made it do
so. Each took up his task. Mr. Zendt, with his new
investigations, and the electricians and other staff
men, left the matter that had no bearing on their results
in the hands of those most interested.</p>
<p>Potts, while Roger located his “sound” list, speculated
about the situation.</p>
<p>“That Ellison come out on top in the chemistry retroactivities,”
he began, and when Roger had substituted
“reactions,” he proceeded:</p>
<p>“But are you so sure, Rog’?”</p>
<p>“Well, the way Grover works, I am not sure and I
am not un-sure. I’m going to dig to the heart of truth.
Now, with our clues, we have a lot of circumstantial
evidence-clues; and we have a heap of visible clues;
but I think the audible ones will tell most, just as
Grover does.”</p>
<p>“Circumstantial evidence? Such as what?”</p>
<p>“People being at certain places. Here, maybe, when
something happened. And like Mister Ellison arriving
just when we least expected.”</p>
<p>“Then, what about visible ones?”</p>
<p>“The animals on a film taken in a room with no
animals in it. The actions of people, if we could only
read them. The picture in the office, last night, with
a man’s back turned, Astrovox scared, and the smoke.”</p>
<p>“The others—the vocational clues——”</p>
<p>“Do you mean ‘vocal’?”</p>
<p>“Uh-hum. Them I know most of. But there’s ol—olle—something
about a factory——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>“Olfactory? Clues coming from smells? I think
you’ve got something. The powder smell, for one.”</p>
<p>“And now, how will we coagulate ’em?”</p>
<p>He was fond of that word, erroneously used, before—but
to him a discovery.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Roger admitted, “there must be
some link.”</p>
<p>He suggested that inasmuch as the man in the office
shot had worn gloves, as revealed on his outspread
hands, no finger prints had been left when he had
inadvertently pressed the desk button.</p>
<p>“But there might be clues on the floor, if they
haven’t been tracked up too much,” Roger suggested.
“You do some micro-photography while I revise my
list.”</p>
<p>The list he located in their office file, behind the
registrations he had previously looked up to find the
clue, as it had seemed, that Zendt, with Australian experiences,
must know about kangaroos, while Ellison—there
he cropped up again! could know, from India
work, about the ape they had seen in the film of the
upper room.</p>
<p>Looking over his list, in the light of what had
happened, Roger was inclined to drop out the seemingly
unimportant fact that the case had begun when
both the fire and the protective system alarms had
rung. He felt that it had no discernible connection
with his mystery, being so easily accounted for by the
fact that an ape and a kangaroo had evidently gamboled
around in the studio, setting off alarms unwittingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Still, half-hesitant, he left it in, but re-wrote his list,
so as to put what seemed important in order, rather
than try to follow the succession of historical order, as
he had done before.</p>
<p>His list, thus revised and added to, ran this way:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tbody><tr class="th"><th><i>Sound</i> </th><th><i>Possible Meaning</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">1. Frying-grease-like clicks and hisses and pops. </td><td class="l">Claws of animal. Radiator valve with steam coming in. A snake, with its scales rattling. A lizard, like the big Iguanas.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">2. Voice of Doom. </td><td class="l">Tibetans’ trick to frighten. A recording made in Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">3. Voice of Doom again. </td><td class="l">On a record
 supposed to be new. Query: how did Tibetans know all about our stock to
 substitute? Query, could Ellison have done it?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">4. Doctor Ryder’s talk with man on record with No. 3. </td><td class="l">Voice
 was his. We thought and he admitted it was Mr. Clark he was talking
with. Query, we thought it was to conceal identity that Mr. Clark wrote;
 wonder if it was not a talk with him in room, if he telephoned instead?
 Is Mr. Clark completely cleared: he is a jeweler.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">5. Clicks in headset. </td><td class="l">Could be so many electrical switch noises or relays, but why was it so close to hearing Voice of Doom?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">6. Drip or click in dark. </td><td class="l">Was just
before safe was opened, but was it the combination being worked by
expert who could tell by sound when tumblers fell right? Does that make
me think of Clark, a jeweler? Not Tibetans as we had thought from
circumstances. Is Ellison able to work a combination “by ear”?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">7. Thump or thud sound. </td><td class="l">Seemed to
come in corner of room upstairs just before I took the film that
produced the animal ‘ghosts’ after we had heard Voice of Doom from up
there. I wonder how important it really is, or if it was just plaster or
 a film in a can?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">8. A sort of thump on Record when Dr. Ryder vanished. </td><td class="l">We
 thought he had been knocked down by a blow with recorder operating. But
 it turned out he had gone away with Clark. Or so Clark said. Has Clark
got some hold over Doctor Ryder that made him go after a telephone
summons? Was that thump the telephone taken off hook? Not likely as it
would be a click like what I heard in headset. Do these tell me
anything?</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">9. The cry of fire and crackle of flame on unused record in my room. </td><td class="l">No
 fire, and no reason for cry. Wait! It was like what old Astrovox said
when we were collecting old papers in upper room? Is it possible anybody
 made a record of it? But Potts was the only one who was fixing
protection machines in my room. Yes, and Potts says he threw away what
turns out to be the real Eye of Om. Oh, it can’t be.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">11. Shot recorded in the lab films at same time as flash. </td><td class="l">A
 brain-teaser. It was an explosive sound, that synchronized with flash
in film: and there was the smell of burned powder. How does it fit? Did
Clark or Ellison do it to try to shoot the man at the desk? Or did
either one do it at the other?</td></tr>
<tr class="pbtr"><td colspan="2">
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">12. The Tibetan talked English. </td><td class="l">It <i>is</i> ‘sound’ and might have some clue, he used English in a Tibet monastery, and in America again.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">14. Grind as if rocks on records, after Voice of Doom. </td><td class="l">Missing
 in real Tibet sound, as rock was counter-weighted and moved silently
open and shut. Seems important, because it was on record probably made
in Tibet and brought here by—Tibet lama? Clark? Ellison? Zendt?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">15. Voice of Doom heard by Astrovox. </td><td class="l">Was it record, same as others? Or what? I must ask when he recovers if it had grind at end of moan.</td></tr>

<h2 id="c28"><br>Chapter 27
<br>A “THERMAL” TRICK</h2>
<p>With every meaning that he tried to attach
to his listings, Roger found himself growing more confused.</p>
<p>He had only imaginative evidence against any of
the names he had inserted in his diary-like notations.
As he scanned his list Roger saw that he had done less
interpreting than speculating; but he saw no way to
make interpretation of the listings get him anywhere.</p>
<p>He filed it with his former list, and went to his
routine, so that Toby could go to dinner.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was without apparent development.</p>
<p>Toby, leaving the suitcase, at closing time, went
home. The others did the same. Roger and Tip remained
until last.</p>
<p>“Well, Grover has stayed close to Doctor Ryder’s
patient,” Tip mused, aloud. “That is, the patient
Doctor Ryder just missed getting, because I told the
druggists I wanted ‘aggrenalin’ and they said they
never heard of nothing like it. If I’d of got the right
name, he’d of saved Astrovox ’stead of the internes
doing it.”</p>
<p>“I talked over the wire with my cousin,” responded
Roger. “Just make an extra check on everything for
safety’s sake, and he says for us to <i>stay away</i> from here,
tonight, no matter what we hear. You are to go to a
hotel to sleep. And he says you must.”</p>
<p>“What’s going to happen here?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>“I wish I guessed,” Roger retorted, “but I don’t
seem able to do even that. With all the clues on my
list or somewhere in the films and so on, I just see
new developments, and they are worse than before,
and confuse me.”</p>
<p>“What say we go to one of those spirit mediators.”</p>
<p>“A medium? A fortune teller?”</p>
<p>“She might coagulate our ideas.”</p>
<p>“Curdle them? She probably would.”</p>
<p>“It means to make ’em set—hang together.”</p>
<p>Roger chuckled and refused. He wanted to work
out every circuit, trace every wire, be certain that
when he locked up, nothing could get in or out of that
research laboratory without leaving a record and if
anything happened then—well—he’d have to look to
Tip about it!</p>
<p>Potts said good-night, and went away as instructed.</p>
<p>At home, telling with some reserves his experiences
of the night before, to his aunt, Roger felt a constant
tugging of desire to go and see if all was right.</p>
<p>Grover’s orders to stay away were, he felt, a magnet
drawing, tugging, pulling him toward the forbidden
place.</p>
<p>What danger, he wondered, might lurk in just a
visit?</p>
<p>Still, he obeyed, against every dragging urge.</p>
<p>Toby Smith telephoned about nine o’clock.</p>
<p>“Say, can we get into that lab?”</p>
<p>“Why, Toby?”</p>
<p>“I clean forgot to put away Doctor Ryder’s compounds.
I put down his suitcase, and got busy with
Mr. Zendt who wanted a heap of chemicals, and it
slipped my mind.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>“Orders are not to go there at night,” Roger told
him.</p>
<p>“Well—but he said lock ’em in the safety cabinet,
against fire. I forgot. Well——”</p>
<p>“But there won’t be any fire.”</p>
<p>“But—lookit, Roger—you didn’t notice, maybe——”</p>
<p>“That you had marked on a paper a list of words?
I did. Fireworks. Pyrotechnics. Lycopodium.”</p>
<p>“Well—I mixed some—an’ left ’em in a big tray
till tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Roger gasped, at his end of the connection.</p>
<p>Suppose a gas in the atmosphere reacted with some
exposed ingredient?</p>
<p>All at once, though, a person so far totally unsuspected
began to assume importance.</p>
<p>This Toby Smith! He had originally sold, for a
camera, a gem supposed to have been both sacred
and invaluable.</p>
<p>He had been to Tibet before, Doctor Ryder had
mentioned. (He could have known the value of that
gem).</p>
<p>Besides, here he was, at a time when Grover had
explicitly forbidden Roger, for some hidden reason,
against going near the lab. And he was insisting on
his disobedience of orders by implying dire happenings!</p>
<p>Roger hesitated.</p>
<p>Why was it important for him to be lured to the
laboratory? Had Clark not explained to the Tibetans
about the blunder through which the real jewel, jettisoned
by Clark, picked up by Potts, had been lost,
they might want to lure him, to bring some idea
of revenge to pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Why should Toby want to do that?</p>
<p>Perhaps, Roger speculated, the youth wanted to
get him there and then by use of force open the
safe or some other thing.</p>
<p>The value of their own laboratory formulae and
data was not less, to them, than a jewel such as the
Eye of Aum.</p>
<p>“Against orders!”</p>
<p>Roger, his decision made, started to hang up.</p>
<p>“You’d let that stuff explode, maybe——”</p>
<p>“Listen, Toby. I obey the Boss. Besides, don’t
worry. We have a positive-action, fire smothering gas
in drums, and a thermostat that operates a relay,
much like those on heating equipment, at a rise of
eight degrees from the normal shown by another thermometer
outside the lab. The gas smothers any fire.
Chemicals, even.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Then I needn’t worry.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t worry, Toby.”</p>
<p>Hanging up, Roger waited for a further effort.</p>
<p>When it came—if it <i>was</i> a new attempt!—its form
was startling.</p>
<p>The inter-connecting fire alarm in the library of
his home rang. Roger considered for a moment. Of
course, the gas should cover every possible danger,
save everything. Even against the delicate electric adjustments
and the unreplaceable devices, the gas would
work without harming them as water might do.</p>
<p>The thought brought another.</p>
<p>“Water!”</p>
<p>The firemen would respond to the alarm, sent out
over the telephone, to Headquarters, automatically.</p>
<p>Water would ruin the delicate armatures, coils, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>And how could the alarm go off by human means
when he had made so certain that no one could enter?</p>
<p>He decided to try to get Grover at the hospital
where he waited for any word, or murmur, raving
or otherwise, from the unconscious astrologer.</p>
<p>Grover was not available, they told him. He had
gone out to get a late repast.</p>
<p>Grover would not be available for an hour. Roger
could not see the laboratory electrical apparatus
ruined. The order to stay away had not taken this
development into account.</p>
<p>He got a taxi and was hurried to the vicinity of the
lab.</p>
<p>Already he heard the screech of sirens, as at the
start of the queer chain of contradictions, impossibilities
and misfits.</p>
<p>This time, though, a weird orange-reddish glow
came up into the cloudy sky from above their skylight!</p>
<p>As Roger leaped out, flinging the taximan a dollar,
the glow was quashed as if by magic. The system of
protection had worked.</p>
<p>He stopped the breaking of the door, as before,
but this time with no need for argument. The X-Ray
and fluoroscope were not going as they had been that
former time.</p>
<p>Hastily Roger located the Captain of the first company
to have arrived: he knew that the one so scoring
a beat was in charge, stayed till last, was responsible.
It was “his fire.”</p>
<p>Rapidly he told as much as was necessary to convince
the man that no further damage could possibly
ensue, but he found the man hard to convince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>“But I declare,” Roger insisted, “the lycopodium
and stuff that you saw blazing up through the skylight
was just fireworks compounds, made up—I begin
to think—for just that use. It made a grand glow, but
probably blazed only in a tray. The room it was in is
fireproof. Our film is all non-flam, in sealed or airtight
cans. Our chemicals are in airtight containers.”</p>
<p>He added that his check of the tell-tale, on the
brief entry he had made, disclosed no entrances by
others. Such was impossible.</p>
<p>“Then how was the stuff ignited? Spontaneous
combustion.”</p>
<p>“I suppose some gas was left open, on purpose, that
would in time penetrate to the chemicals in the mixture.
But the heat of that little couple of pounds of
powder burning ten minutes would not raise our fire-thermostat
more than a degree, and it must go up
six or eight to set off the alarm.”</p>
<p>“The alarm came in, young fellow. How?”</p>
<p>Roger took him across to a drug store. In its window,
against the wall, a huge advertising thermometer
registered Fahrenheit degrees and stood at sixty-four.
He hurried the man back, showed him the small interconnected
thermometer for registering air temperature,
against which the other inside one reacted. This
one stood at fifty-five.</p>
<p>“Somebody wanted the alarm set off to lure me
here—simple trick. Only had to hold ice on this one
till it dropped eight degrees <i>below</i> the other and then
the other would be eight above it and off went the
alarm.”</p>
<p>Fire, an alarm adjusted for heat, set off by ice!
Toby? Who else?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h2 id="c29"><br>Chapter 28
<br>THE FUSE</h2>
<p>From the pay station in the drug store
Roger got the hospital and was connected with
Grover.</p>
<p>“Is Astrovox all right? Did he say anything?”</p>
<p>“He will probably recover, Roger, but he won’t
talk for many days, perhaps for weeks.”</p>
<p>Rapidly, concisely, Roger outlined the situation.</p>
<p>“But I told you——”</p>
<p>“I am not in the lab. I went right away from there,
making sure all the safety things were still on, before
the firemen had pulled away.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go back, no matter what. And—Roger—be
sure your room is protected fully before you go to
bed.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Do you know?—who is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know who it is, but some desperate person
has determined to protect him or herself by any necessary
means.”</p>
<p>“The Tibetans?”</p>
<p>“I think not, Roger.”</p>
<p>It was some person or group recognized by Astrovox.
That recognition had led to the blow he was
suffering from.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, it was not fatal,” Grover continued,
“and I stayed here less to hear him, for I knew that
would not be probable. I was here to protect him if
anyone, knowing he lived, tried more desperate
methods still.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>“You can’t stay day and night.”</p>
<p>“No,” answered Grover. “Potts is on his way here
now. I will be home in an hour or a little more than
an hour.”</p>
<p>Roger asked one more question.</p>
<p>“Why would they want to lure me to the lab?”</p>
<p>“No other way to get in.”</p>
<p>“But they did get in, Grover. The lyco——”</p>
<p>“Probably touched off with a long pole, from the
skylight. They could break the glass, insert a long
pole, like the one we use to shift the ventilators. To
draw firemen who would smash in—or set off an alarm
that would bring you, especially after the preparation
by Toby.”</p>
<p>“Then he——”</p>
<p>“Probably someone either paid him well, or else, as
I think is more likely, he really had left the powder
there. Some one knew it.”</p>
<p>“Why should I be bothered?”</p>
<p>Grover’s theory was that through his reputation as
the Ear Detective, or else because of some film or
other data, the suspected miscreant feared him as he
had feared Astrovox.</p>
<p>The conversation ended and Roger, finding his old
friend, the taxi driver, on his night station, used his
car.</p>
<p>At home he made certain that the devices, moved
from Doctor Ryder’s residence, which no longer
seemed threatened, because the absence of the Eye of
Om had been explained to the Tibetans, all worked.
He shifted the recording needle a dozen turns of the
threaded arm that made it follow a spiral path. The
call of “fire” and the crackling noises occupied only
the start of the disk. He set the recorder to fall in
place further over toward the center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Switching on the electrically charged locks, he kept
his desk lamp burning while he retired.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to turn it out, the light died.</p>
<p>Thinking that the bulb had been used up, he tried
another light, just as a precaution, recalled to mind
by the doctor’s experience.</p>
<p>That light was unresponsive.</p>
<p>At once Roger raced to the door into the hall.</p>
<p>With no current the lock, with his key inside,
turned readily.</p>
<p>Intuition told him what had happened here, as in
the other instance.</p>
<p>The cellar fuse box had been opened and a fuse had
been removed. That prevented current from entering
the circuits, and even the alarm was silent, although
he knew that cutting off the current served as well as
any other way to start the recorder disk and the camera.
He cut them off hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I’ll want them, maybe, a little later,” he told himself.
“Whoever did this will have to come up two
flights of stairs. It will give me just time to re-adjust
them to go on again, if I want. And I hope he or she
or it left the fuse by the box.”</p>
<p>He had a plan. A trap, made useless to protect him,
could be made useful to hold someone else!</p>
<p>Slipping into his bathroom, with his clothes carefully
tucked under his arm, Roger unlocked the door
into Grover’s adjoining room.</p>
<p>He went in there stealthily.</p>
<p>Then, waiting, he listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>His one danger lay in the chance that the miscreant
might come by way of Grover’s room, if it was known
to be empty.</p>
<p>As he heard someone working a jimmy or other
springing implement on his door, very quietly,
though, he slipped into the hall with as little noise
as the hinges of the door allowed. It was hardly likely
that the slight squeaks were audible down the hall.</p>
<p>He saw a man, bent low, his back fortunately turned
that way, as he tried to snap open the lock without
much noise, perhaps trusting that Roger slept soundly
and would not awaken.</p>
<p>Like a wraith slipping without sound along a
haunted hallway, Roger got to the stairway. Its noise
must be risked. He trod close to the wall side, stepping
two lifts down to avoid a known faulty stair.</p>
<p>It required nice psychological deduction to enable
him to use his trap, if the fuse was available. The
marauder, or worse, must be in the room, and as Roger
hoped, he would probably have shut the door to muffle
any commotion from getting to other possibly occupied
rooms.</p>
<p>Once in, the person would see he was not in bed,
and had not been, and would either take a moment
to discover if he hid, or would pause to consider; he
must have been watching, must have seen Roger arrive.</p>
<p>The fuse, when he snapped on a cellar bulb in the
garage, was on a ledge under the switch box. Was it
too soon, Roger wondered, to screw it into the tiny
receptacle?</p>
<p>He must not wait too long. His absence once assured,
suspicion and fear would drive out the one who
was now <i>his</i> quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>He must risk it at once.</p>
<p>He screwed home the small 15-ampere fuse.</p>
<p>With hopeful heart and padding feet he ran up the
cellar steps, up the next flight, and paused to take
observations.</p>
<p>All was quiet.</p>
<p>Had his trap sprung? He could tell by finding a
rubber glove among Grover’s things, with which to
try the knob he had so recently turned with ease into
his bathroom.</p>
<p>He got the insulating glove from among some old
laboratory togs, too big for him but satisfactory for
his need.</p>
<p>With care he turned the knob. The door did not
yield. The system was on.</p>
<p>A difficulty came into mind.</p>
<p>To see if he had a captive he must release the heavy
charge, by use of a small cable-key that broke the
circuit. If his presumable evil-wisher was caught, he
might get out before Roger could re-set the system.</p>
<p>He listened. There was not an audible sound, coming
through the door.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><br>Chapter 29
<br>A SURPRISING CAPTURE</h2>
<p>A sound in the lower hall made Roger turn.
To his delight, Grover came in. Quickly the younger
cousin set out the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>“Go down and draw the fuse again,” Grover suggested.
“Queer that I did not think of that simple
way to nullify all our protection. It explains how the
safe was so easily opened, as well as Doctor Ryder’s
situation. When you are ready, pull only the ten
ampere fuse in the equalizer of the circuit marked
number four.”</p>
<p>Roger knew that the switch and fuse box held different
fuses for various parts of the home, with two
heavier fuses set into the main feed from the street.
Grover’s idea was, he saw, to eliminate the front portion
of the house including his room, while the light
in the rear of the hall, and his aunt’s quarters, would
be left on. In that way, with a front hall light going,
Grover could tell when the fuse was out and have
light enough in the hall to work by.</p>
<p>As soon as he had performed his task he ran up
the steps, to find Grover, extremely surprised, facing,
in the hall, the last man they had suspected of interest
in the matter.</p>
<p>The assistant electrical engineer, Mr. Millman,
stood there.</p>
<p>“A lame explanation,” Grover was saying as Roger
arrived.</p>
<p>“To you, maybe. To me it seems reasonable that
I would have hit on the method somebody used to
get to the safe and I think it is perfectly logical that
I should test out my theory that Roger had been playing
all those tricks in the laboratory.”</p>
<p>“What tricks?” Roger demanded.</p>
<p>“This one, if you want a sample.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Millman walked over to the recording device, exchanged
from his pocket a reproducer, made a quick
wire connection to Roger’s compact table radio, as
Roger had had the connection when the recorder had
roughly re-played the formerly recorded cry and
crackles.</p>
<p>“I was making a recording of motor sparking, and
just as I set our lab. machine going, I realized that
the diamond was cutting a sound record, not just
running smoothly. You can tell if you are watching
closely, as I was. We cut out the record, took it off,
and I told Ellison and Zendt to say nothing. I began
to suspect that Roger, who was up with Astrovox, was
having fun at our expense.”</p>
<p>He set the machine going and the needle, automatically
dropping onto the groove just beyond the
cuttings, as Roger had set it, had to be lifted back.
Then Grover heard, as had Roger before, the cry,
“Fire” and the rattling, crackling as if flames ate dry
wood or paper.</p>
<p>“Now if that was recorded, it had to come from
somewhere. We had not started the sparking motor.”
Millman was earnest. “And I knew that Roger was
up there. Later, unable to find this record, at the
laboratory, I reasoned that it must be that Roger had
brought it to his home. Evidently, I thought, he
wanted to hide it. I decided to make sure. Being an
electrician, I thought, at once, how to get in by pulling
a fuse, not needing to cut wires or put the safety devices
out of commission permanently.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Roger?” Grover turned to his
younger cousin, “Does it strike you as convincing?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he might feel that way.”</p>
<p>“But—with some desperate person abroad——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>“Do I look desperate?” Millman laughed. He was
tallish, and a most serious mannered, quiet, earnest
person. “What motive could <i>I</i> have for wanting to
hurt Roger?”</p>
<p>“You can best answer that,” Grover said quietly.</p>
<p>“I simply wanted to justify my belief that Roger
was behind all the spooky goings-on; the animals on
the films, and so on.” He nodded to show his satisfaction.
“I think I have proved it.”</p>
<p>“Did Potts put this record here?” demanded Grover,
and Roger saw that he was thinking fast.</p>
<p>Hating to add still one more count against the
handy man who had only his own word to support
his declaration that he had flung away a supposably
priceless Eye of Om when Clark had made his blunder
in the temple, and Potts had found the discarded gem,
Roger nodded.</p>
<p>“And how was the recording made? Do you know?”</p>
<p>Again Roger nodded. Grover frowned.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I was helping Astrovox carry away packing papers;
and he mentioned that Mars, the planet, ruled fire.
That word, and the crackle of the paper bunched up
in our arms, would make that sound.”</p>
<p>“Was there an open microphone near you?”</p>
<p>Then Roger started.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then—how?——”</p>
<p>“If we could go to the lab.” Roger had an inspiration,
“I could show you.”</p>
<p>It would keep till morning, Grover decided; and
dismissing Millman with a warning that his actions
were at least not beyond suspicion, Grover set the
cable-switch on, and prepared to sleep with Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>During the balance of the night their rest was undisturbed.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the laboratory, Roger took
Grover to the recording machine.</p>
<p>“You will think I did this, because I know so much
about it,” the youthful radio and sound expert said,
“but it is just putting a meaning behind certain
sounds on my list, and adding the natural explanation.”</p>
<p>His reasoning proved to have been correct.</p>
<p>A strange voice had come unexplainably from an
upper room having no occupant:</p>
<p>Roger bent, examining the mechanism under the
recording turntable. He investigated the contacts
whereby the electrical impulses sent from the small
“mike” at the sparking motor, through the selenium
cell, got into the amplifying transformer-coil to be
increased enough to operate the recording diamond
attaching to a special diaphragm over the disk on the
turntable.</p>
<p>“A wire had been soldered on, here—see,” he
pointed. “Somebody had a wire that didn’t need to
be there. Now, if I just wind this end of a bit of
wire around that contact, to replace the missing one—”
he made the temporary connection, “and lead it down
to one or the other side of the floor outlet, and there
attach it even loosely around one prong of the little
plug-in that furnishes current for the motor of our
recorder, we may discover where the speaker upstairs
is located.”</p>
<p>Hastily he made a temporary splice onto the plug
prong. Grover went up the steps, pausing as Roger
put a commercial test-record in place, switched on the
motor and set the reproducing needle on the groove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Immediately, from upstairs, there came the recording,
in a booming, hollow distortion, natural to the
poor connection and the device they had to locate
above.</p>
<p>Grover, walking over to the corner from which
came the sound, gave a surprised call for his cousin
who shut off the record and ran to the disclosure he
was sure he would find. His guess was right. There,
laid practically flat on one of the empty cabinet shelves,
with its small speaker-unit set into a cutout spot of
the shelves, and concealed by the thick wood it was
let into, was a good sized slab of thin wood.</p>
<p>The wires to the small operating battery concealed
in a non-flam film can, and from that running to a
wall outlet that connected the room devices with the
main source of current, they traced.</p>
<p>A recording had been made, downstairs, of voices
in the upper room.</p>
<p>To all appearances there was no microphone up
there to have conveyed the voice and paper-rattle.
Apparently there was no loud speaker up there to
have broadcast the Voice of Doom so bafflingly.</p>
<p>“You say to dig past appearances,” Roger reminded
his cousin, “and while they can be falsified, the truth
never changes. Well, if it ‘appears’ that there is no
mike, and that there is no speaker, we know we heard
the Voice of Doom, and we know we heard the recording
made by Astrovox, upstairs, on a record, downstairs.”</p>
<p>“There is, naturally, some connecting wire. But—it
does not show. You know more about radio than I,
Roger. Have you located it?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>“Well, when we used to build experimental sets,
before commercial radios got to be common and
reasonable in price, I used to try to record my own
voice, so I could play it back. I used the same sort
of radio hookup for that, I think, that is used in
making commercial phonograph records—only, I
didn’t have a carbon mike, so I tried reversing the
function of the speaker I had. It was a Balsa-wood one,
that I assembled from a small vibrator-unit, and a
flat slab of thin Balsa-wood.”</p>
<p>“Used the speaker as a microphone or telephone
receiver would be used today.”</p>
<p>“Right, Grover. And, another thing I remember
from my experiments. There was a device that was
supposed to use the house electric wiring as an antenna—an
aerial. If you put a special plug, with only <i>one</i>
prong instead of two the way regular electric contacts
are made, in a wall outlet, the circuit of the house
current was not carried at all, and the single contact
went to the aerial binding-post of my set, and made
the whole house wiring act like an antenna. There
was a terrible line-hum. It wasn’t practical. But I
think——”</p>
<p>“As long as only one ‘side’ of the house current is
tapped,” Roger told his cousin and Chief, “and the
part it connects with is not grounded, it will act like
an antenna—or, in this hookup, it makes any of our
outlets a conductor between whatever is plugged into
it and the Balsa-wood speaker.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>“Besides Ellison and Millman, both electricians,”
Grover mused out loud, “Potts would know, at least
from observation, a lot of electrical ‘stunts’. This one,
possibly. And he knows how to record; and all about
microphones, speakers and other apparatus that he has
to adjust in his regular laboratory duties.”</p>
<p>Another count against Potts, Roger thought—at
least by implication in the evidence.</p>
<p>But, then again, it also pointed to Ellison or Millman,
maybe both.</p>
<p>Toby arrived. As with Roger he viewed the cremated
powders, and the melted metal tray on a
scorched table of fireproofed wood under a zinc
sheathing, where his “pyrotechnics” had burned,
Roger had to admit to himself that the youth’s manner
and expression indicated sincere shame that he
had experimented and had left his combustibles exposed.
But, then, the call had come, last night, so
close ahead of the fire alarm that had led to his trip
to the lab. Had Toby been lurking nearby after having
chilled the outside thermometer enough to cause
the one on the alarm system to be higher and to set
off the device? There had not been enough heat to
release the gas, he made certain of that at once. Toby
<i>might</i> be one of those “dumb”-clever fellows who
pretended to be ignorant to cover up something, to
keep suspicion away from themselves. He decided to
add Toby to his list of potentially suspectable people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<h2 id="c31"><br>Chapter 30
<br>THE VOICELESS WARNING</h2>
<p>Since Astrovox would be away for a good
while and his experiments could hardly be picked up
by anyone else, Roger was told to arrange a temporary
home for the rabbits, squirrels and mice and rats he
had been experimenting on; and a nearby pet shop
agreed to house them.</p>
<p>In assembling their cages, Roger noticed several of
the mice showing symptoms of being very nearly done
for.</p>
<p>“What do you suppose is wrong?” he asked Doctor
Ryder, who was clearing aside some of the absent
man’s apparatus in order to set up his cages again.
He expected a fresh litter of white rats for his medical
experiments.</p>
<p>“There was a fire, wasn’t there?”</p>
<p>“You think the smoke overcame them, Doctor?”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Roger.” He wrote down some stimulating
combinations of medicinal chemicals to try on
them.</p>
<p>The bio-chemist, Zendt, also took an interest.</p>
<p>“Of course, if the lamps are already turned off,”
he said, “it is that the smoke overcame them. That
little fellow is particularly bad.”</p>
<p>He indicated a tiny mouse of the sort used in the
experiments, lying almost as if in a coma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Roger, with his quick sympathy, and with Toby
eagerly obeying orders, improvised a makeshift “oxygen
tent” and since it would be in the way in the room
already crowded with the cages and plant-beds, he
took the small stimulator with its tiny occupant into
the dark-room where he could attend to it and watch
the mouse’s reaction and response while he developed
some plates taken by the staff the afternoon before.</p>
<p>The mouse, Roger saw with pleasure, gave signs of
reviving.</p>
<p>So quickly it recuperated that he put it back into a
cage, but kept it near him in the dark-room while he
saw, on the developing plates, slow images emerge.</p>
<p>The pictures, photographs of crystal formations,
he finished, making wet-contact prints. These he took
to Mr. Zendt. Others, of the old astrologer’s, he put
aside to print later. They would not be needed for
some time.</p>
<p>Coming back, Roger observed that his tiny patient
was apparently much better. He dissembled the oxygen
apparatus, and was about to take it to his stock-room,
to the section where spare apparatus was stored, when
he had a visitor.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, his Tibetan traveling companion, the
well-to-do jeweler, came in through the light-trap,
with a cheerful greeting.</p>
<p>“How are you doing?” he inquired, “and what is
the latest quotation on Tibetan’s, common.” His stock-market
joke made Roger grin.</p>
<p>“Glad you didn’t say ‘Tibetan’s, preferred.’” he
answered. “As far as I know, they certainly are not
preferred. The quotation is lower-than-minus. No
sale.”</p>
<p>He was wondering what might be the object of the
call.</p>
<p>Not a visit for love he was sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>“I hear there was almost a tragedy here,” the rich
gem expert was getting to the point, Roger surmised.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>He was not going to give information.</p>
<p>“Poor old star-gazer. He should have seen his fate
coming. If his star-reading could warn him, why didn’t
he take care?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He had said something about Neptune
and Saturn in opposition and Mars opposed to
Uranus, with the world between the opposite planets,
pulled this way and that, if I understand him. Maybe
he was trying to take care of himself, but he always
says we are put into this world to have certain experiences.
We cannot escape them, and what the stars’
forces did to influence our cells in brain and body at
birth, he thinks, indicates what sort of experiences
we will have.”</p>
<p>Roger, seldom over-talkative, was willing to expand
this idea.</p>
<p>Not that he wholly grasped what it meant. Nor was
he “sold” on the star philosophy. But it diverted Mr.
Clark from whatever plan he had come there to try,
Roger thought; and if he was right about it, Clark
would come back to his subject and would thus show
Roger what it was.</p>
<p>“Astrovox often said,” he hurried on with the topic,
“we cannot avoid our Destiny, escape experiences.
But we have what he called Free Will to decide how
we will meet them.”</p>
<p>“A very sound philosophy, Roger. But——”</p>
<p>“Now he’s going to give himself away,” decided
Roger.</p>
<p>“But—where have you put The Eye of Om?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Roger, petrified by amazement, could only stare,
in the dim, ruby dark-room light. “I?——”</p>
<p>“Yes. Eye of Om. You really took it, of course.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Clark!” Roger drew himself to his full height
in sudden anger at the challenge, the accusation.</p>
<p>“Well, how else could it have happened? You know,
for you saw, when the prongs in the Buddha’s forehead
socket were loosened, I took out the old gem
and put in a new one—the one we had brought. And
when you sent Potts back, do you imagine I am idiot
enough to believe that <i>he</i> knew one stone from another,
or that he found the one I chucked away into
a regular abyss, there in the Himalayas?”</p>
<p>He scowled.</p>
<p>“You went there. You saw the real stone put in.
You sent Potts to—shall I say the real word? No—to
bring it—that’s close and not quite so evil-sounding
as the fact. Anyway, Roger, do you think we don’t
how loyal Potts is to you? He would tell any sort of
story, just to protect you.”</p>
<p>“Say, you go and tell Grover that.”</p>
<p>Roger was boiling.</p>
<p>Clark, scanning his working face, calmly chuckled.</p>
<p>“Your films will be overdone, or whatever happens
if you forget them.”</p>
<p>Roger, reminded, hastily extracted from trays the
plates of an experiment with chemical diffusion, and
got them into hypo.</p>
<p>“I shan’t bother Grover. We discussed it and he
suggested coming to you. As long as this way doesn’t
elicit the information, perhaps there will be other
methods. You know what taking the gem means to
those Tibetans?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Roger, fuming, smarting under the unjust accusation,
refused to reply.</p>
<p>Turning on his heel, Mr. Clark left.</p>
<p>Roger washed his negatives, made his prints.</p>
<p>To his surprise his pet, the tiny mouse, began to run
about, to show unmistakable signs of animation—or
was it of excitement?</p>
<p>Roger studied him.</p>
<p>The tiny animal was racing around its cage.</p>
<p>Memory of the fact that such mice on submarines
indicated the presence of leaks from battery or engine
of undetected gases such as sulphuric acid gas came.
He wondered if his dark-room held such a menace to
respiration. He decided to take the mouse to the outer
air and observe its reaction.</p>
<p>To his dismay, the inner door of the light trap did
not respond.</p>
<p>He was wedged or otherwise fastened in. And the
mouse was certainly exhibiting signs of uneasiness.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><br>Chapter 31
<br>THE HIDDEN MENACE</h2>
<p>Instead of shouting, beating on the door and
otherwise wasting energy and using up the available
oxygen of the room, Roger paused, taking only the
precaution of mounting on a high developing table,
to avoid any floor accumulation of poisonous fumes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Such mice, he remembered, could detect a dangerous
fume long before human nostrils caught the
odor; and this made them life-savers on submarines.
They gave the crews time to trace gas fumes and suppress
or nullify their effect.</p>
<p>“Now, there isn’t any gas I know of in what I am
using,” Roger spoke, under his breath, to his tiny
companion, just as most people will discuss an
emergency with a dog or cat.</p>
<p>Fumes of such chemicals as he might use for “reducing”
and “intensifying” improperly exposed
negatives gave off offensive odors in certain mixtures;
but he had mixed none. Hypo was not dangerous:
and the ventilating system should have sucked away
any fumes of whatever sort, he knew.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the animal grew still more excited.</p>
<p>Roger lighted the white, glaring dome light, ignoring
possible ruining of the developing plates in his
trays.</p>
<p>He knew every content of that room.</p>
<p>Nothing was out of place except what he had been
using.</p>
<p>There was the extra paraphernalia of the oxygen
apparatus. Nothing else was visible.</p>
<p>It came to him that no odor or fume could be
liberated that would cause such frenzy in the little
white savior unless it was introduced from an outside
source.</p>
<p>He would find out.</p>
<p>He went to the intake of the ventilator, and with
litmus paper, and other handy agents, he made several
tests, keeping his nose and lips within the tight folds
of a handkerchief as he did it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The litmus did not at once indicate anything. But
when he thought of what he had sometimes read of
closed garages, with car engines running, in which
people had been overcome by exhaust fumes such as
carbon monoxide, he made a hasty test, with what
he had available, and was very sure that the gas or one
of that nature, was in the air.</p>
<p>A tiny animal might be going to save his life. Roger
knew his next move. He would shut the ventilator,
prevent the inflow of any more fumes, leaving the exhaust
openings to suck clear the accumulation which
would lie near the floor. He got his oxygen equipment,
and climbing onto the highest table, he made an improvised
airman’s outfit such as they used when ascending
beyond the human range of breathable air.
He used his oxygen and mixed it with air inhaled only
through a handkerchief strainer.</p>
<p>He thought in this way he could hold out, and then
whoever had come so close to being in line for the
electric chair——. He watched the mouse for signs.</p>
<p>After a few minutes the animal, at his level, quieted.</p>
<p>Roger, allowing still more time, finally laid aside
his protective “gas mask” arrangement, and quietly
tried the door. It had been unwedged. He did not
emerge, however, but went into a corner to wait.</p>
<p>Whoever might open that door, he thought——</p>
<p>A criminal would haunt the scene, to see the effect
of his plan.</p>
<p>Would it, he wondered, be Clark? He had threatened.
Or—Toby? Or Millman? Of course not the
Tibetans. They were not chemists: they were priests.</p>
<p>He grew tense, watchful.</p>
<p>The outer light-trap door was being opened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h2 id="c33"><br>Chapter 32
<br>SCIENCE FIGHTS CRAFT</h2>
<p>Watching, Roger saw and recognized the
man who entered. The bio-chemist, Zendt, came in
with a film magazine of exposed celluloid in one
hand.</p>
<p>“How are my diffusion shots coming along?”</p>
<p>“In the hypo.”</p>
<p>Roger watched narrowly.</p>
<p>Zendt was either a master of facial control or he was
one of those “innocent bystanders” who manage to
intrude when some crucial point of a drama is about
to be played.</p>
<p>“Please develop this run from the speed camera.
Ellison and Millman have caught the torque of their
erratic motor on film. Sixteen exposures to a foot—a
million to the minute. Shooting time, one half
minute. Does that tell you the size of reel to wind
it on?”</p>
<p>Roger, making mental computation with one side
of his mind as he studied the situation with the other,
nodded.</p>
<p>He would put the ceiling light out, but he would
not satisfy Zendt by staying there. Perhaps the man
came prepared to hold him at his dark-room work in
case he had not yet been sufficiently dosed.</p>
<p>“Bring you prints soon,” he told Zendt. “I’ll get
this into a developing tank.” He risked a question.</p>
<p>“Is anybody in the cellar? The ventilator seems to
be choked. No air comes in. It’s—stuffy.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>“Maybe. Millman was down, earlier. Potts hasn’t
come. Grover has gone out.” To let Potts get sleep,
to stand guard over Astrovox, Roger decided.</p>
<p>“I’ll telephone down and see—oh, look. It was shut
off.”</p>
<p>Clever actor or innocent intruder, Zendt betrayed
neither interest nor disappointment. He simply
nodded and went out.</p>
<p>Roger considered his position.</p>
<p>He reasoned: if Zendt was blameless, some one else
was watching. From seeing Zendt emerge the unknown
would be sure that Roger was still all right.
But if he left, all possibility of detecting who was the
culprit might be gone.</p>
<p>Still, he had no chemicals in assortments that would
enable him to detect the possible introduction of some
fume through a hole in the walls, or some other move.
Besides, he was open to bodily attack.</p>
<p>He must not be there. No one must see him leave.</p>
<p>He remembered that there were chemicals that he
would need, and inasmuch as he was known to be all
right, he could easily get them.</p>
<p>He emerged, seeing Doctor Ryder busy with his
arrival of white rats, with Toby helping him put them
into the glass pen through the trapdoor in the top
that prevented them from escaping.</p>
<p>“Got to force-up some underexposed negatives,”
he remarked as he passed them. To the stock-room he
went, and procured the ingredients he needed; but
not for an intensifier for under-exposed film! Returning,
he noticed Zendt, watching the rats also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Once more in the dark-room Roger proceeded
methodically and carefully to produce a very businesslike
detonating torpedo with crystals of gritty hard
iron oxide-rust! to take the place of the gravel usually
packed in a commercial torpedo of the sort formerly
sold for exploding by contact with the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The other ingredients he mixed with care as to
method, as well as formula, knowing that certain
chemicals must be combined in a certain sequence.
Wrapped in a fairly good paper taken from a packet
of printing paper, he had his torpedo ready at last.</p>
<p>There was no window from which to fling it, but
he knew that by putting a chair on the developing
table by the wall, he could get his hands up to the
small outlet around the exhaust fan. The old equipment,
discontinued since the laboratory had put in
air-conditioning, led to the open air.</p>
<p>He got to the position carefully, took his torpedo,
and adjusting the small exhaust fan so that its blades
would interfere the least with an open passage for the
missile, he took his chance, against striking the blades,
flinging with a quick jerk of his wrist that sent the
detonator straight through past the fan.</p>
<p>Hurriedly he climbed down and got the chair back
in place as he heard, muffled by the drop, a sharp explosion
on the pavement in front of the laboratory.</p>
<p>He was certain that the noise would draw everybody.</p>
<p>In the space between the outer and the inner light
door he listened. Doctor Ryder and Toby went with
the rest. The way must be free.</p>
<p>Roger, emerging, saw that his guess had been correct.</p>
<p>There, poked up through the skylight coaming, was
the long, and large-girth telescope of Astrovox.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>To an athletic youth, with agility and endurance,
to climb the steadily enlarging, inclined barrel was
no hard task. Once at the top he got over onto the roof
with skilful swings of his body and flexing muscles
drawing him safely over the coaming.</p>
<p>Then he watched, unseen from below, careful to be
on the side facing the sun so as not to let his shadow
reveal his position.</p>
<p>There he watched for an hour as Doctor Ryder and
Toby returned, and others came to the stock-room,
but went away to await his arrival from the dark-room.
Their wants must not be urgent.</p>
<p>The vigil was fruitless, though.</p>
<p>No one entered the dark-room, barely visible in his
quick glances.</p>
<p>A new idea came. He went up the rainspout of the
adjoining roof, using knees for grip and hands to pull
him up from one bracing ring to another. Down the
adjoining fire escape he went, to the top floor of the
candy factory where, to the surprised girls, he whispered,
pretending to be mischievous, “Playing a trick
on the folks next door.” They all knew him, from
seeing him going to and from work. He accepted some
candy, and went down and out onto the street.</p>
<p>He saw no one watching. The brown mark of the
torpedo detonation was still on the pavement. He
slipped into the laboratory cellar, by way of its ash-lift,
unobserved as far as he could tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>To the air-conditioning system he made his way,
trying to see if any of its outlets, especially one to the
dark-room section, had been removed or tampered
with. He saw some signs that a pipe wrench had ground
rough bright spots on the piping, and smiled. His idea
had been right as to where the gas had been sent up.
A survey among old trash awaiting the attention of
Potts revealed a large, empty tank. Some one must
have charged it—whether by purchasing the materials
or by injecting the exhaust from a car he never found
out.</p>
<p>There, though, was his evidence. He left it as it was.</p>
<p>Grover had been right.</p>
<p>Some person or group, with intentions far more
vicious than had been in evidence among the Tibetans,
had marked him. Why? What did he know? Not the
place of the lost Eye of Om. For that they would want
to take him prisoner, to question him. This attack
had been because someone was sure that he knew
more than he did.</p>
<p>Could he find out what he was supposed to know?</p>
<p>To try was Roger’s immediate intention.</p>
<h2 id="c34"><br>Chapter 33
<br>A NEW SUSPICION</h2>
<p>It was Roger’s plan to consult his list of
“sound” evidence and try to make it tell him whatever
secret must be hidden there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>No other plan seemed so likely to be fruitful. If he
was supposed to be in the dark-room, his presence
in the office must show to some guilty person that
Roger was equally alert and crafty. He wanted to
“start something” in the open. Underground methods,
secret attempts to do away with him, were hateful to
open-natured, frank Roger.</p>
<p>Strolling up from the cellar, he watched the effect
of his arrival from that unexpected quarter. Mr.
Millman, discovering him, looked up with a start.</p>
<p>“Hey! Thought you were developing the stuff Zendt
took up.”</p>
<p>Zendt—Millman. Roger connected the two mentally.</p>
<p>“Those speed pictures are important.” Mr. Ellison
scowled, and Roger began to wonder whether his
anger was genuine or if he, himself, was giving too
much importance to a mere annoyance.</p>
<p>“I was just testing my new ‘cloak of invisibility,’”
Roger put on a careless manner. He would give <i>them</i>
something to puzzle about.</p>
<p>“Science is just the reality that used to be fairy
stories,” he said, with a grin. “Pegasus, the flying
horse, was just another way of prophesying airplanes.
And if a magician could wave a wand and turn a beast
into a Prince, doesn’t chemistry transmute base elements
into wonderful, modern products? I got an idea
that the cloak or helmet of invisibility, like the Helmet
in Wagner’s opera that I heard on the radio, is just
the prophecy of some Omega-ray, that makes things
transparent and invisible without hurting them. It
works, too. Did you see me go out?”</p>
<p>“No,” Mr. Millman snapped out the word, adding:</p>
<p>“But we <i>will</i> see you go out—to the observation
ward of the psychopathic division in some hospital if
you waste any more time with this crazy talk.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Roger, thinking quickly, decided that he was hearing
a threat. Millman was not joking. If an astrologer,
coming into the office, had recognized the man, either
facing him or hidden under the desk, and for that
knowledge had come near to being “sent West,” then
it would not be put past such desperate people to believe
they would deliberately put him into the ward
where supposedly insane people are kept, while doctors
studied their mentality.</p>
<p>That, he reflected swiftly, would effectively get him
out of the way; and it would discredit his ideas.</p>
<p>“I was only joking. What’s the matter with everybody?
Snap me up because I chased out past you to
see what the shooting was for.”</p>
<p>“Well, get back to your work. Potts isn’t here. It’s
up to you to keep things going till the Chief says differently.”</p>
<p>Roger looked defiant. He meant to see how far the
man—or the pair, would go.</p>
<p>Doctor Ryder and Mr. Zendt, who had evidently
been conferring on the upper floor about some biochemical
condition of the disease the doctor was studying,
heard the raised voice of the electrical engineer
and came down the stairway.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” asked Doctor Ryder, twisting
his watch chain, which hung across his ample chest.
Roger, who saw the big charm, which hung on the
chain, flicking its golden back in the light, realized,
with an inward start, that the doctor seemed to be
telegraphing with that “heliographic” flicker, as a
Boy Scout would use a mirror to send a message from
his camp to another, from a hilltop.</p>
<p>“Oho!” Roger’s mind was alert, “So he’s telegraphing
somebody.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>He hid his smile of triumph.</p>
<p>“So you’re in it, are you?” he mentally accused.
“Well, two can play that heliograph game. I can read
if you can send.”</p>
<p>While he listened to Mr. Ellison’s angry commands
to get that film developed or the Chief would be
called up, Roger mentally received the flickers of the
heliograph-like gold back of the twisting charm.</p>
<p>“B-e c-a-r-e-f-u-l.”</p>
<p>“Warning him,” Roger’s mental comment was not
audible.</p>
<p>“More?” He saw the charm continue, as if the
doctor was nervous.</p>
<p>“R-o-g-e-r,” it told him.</p>
<p>“He’s warning <i>me</i>!”</p>
<p>Roger, grateful, and glad that his first suspicion
had been unwarranted, waited to see if more would
come, while his facial expression was meant to infuriate
Millman and Ellison.</p>
<p>“B-e-h-i-n-d y-o-u.”</p>
<p>Roger, turning his head, realized that there <i>was</i>
good intention plainly apparent in that peculiar
flicker-warning.</p>
<p>In the office doorway stood a stranger.</p>
<p>Whether he meant good or ill Roger did not know.
But he swung sharply, about to demand the stranger’s
right to intrude beyond the railing when he saw that
the stenographer, Miss Murry, had sent him in.</p>
<p>Roger, taking him in, saw a short, bald-headed, thin
gentleman in a frock coat, striped trousers and a high
silk hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>“I am looking for a Roger Brown,” the man studied
the group. “The office girl thought I ought to find him
in what she calls a dark-room up some stairs. Can you
tell me?”</p>
<p>“I am Roger Brown, sir.”</p>
<p>Roger stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Can I see you in private?”</p>
<p>Roger saw that Doctor Ryder’s watch ornament,
emblem of a secret fraternity, was flicking around
again.</p>
<p>“S-a-y l-i-t-t-l-e,” it seemed to counsel.</p>
<p>“I can take you to my cousin’s private room, sir.”
He nodded to show the doctor that he understood.
“But I can say little about our work until my cousin
is here.” He led the way to the private door. He had
told the doctor that he caught the two words.</p>
<p>“So you are Roger Brown.” The man was seated
in the “thinking den” opposite Roger, who stood
by the window and admired the sumptuous limousine
with its chauffeur, waiting outside.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. How do you know my name, and what
do you want to see me about?”</p>
<p>“I know your name—no matter how. As for what
I came about, I want to dicker with you direct, instead
of with anybody else.”</p>
<p>“Dicker?”</p>
<p>“For the Eye of—er—Aum or Ohm.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think you can dicker with me,
Mister——”</p>
<p>The man did not reveal his name.</p>
<p>“You have the thing.”</p>
<p>“Who says I have?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>“I know you have it, Roger. The point is,” he
glanced at his watch, “and I must hurry—the point is,
you got it. Somebody else offers to get it from you
and sell it to me but I think I may get a better price
from you, direct.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t. Who says you could get it from
him?”</p>
<p>“Young friend of yours—Tobias or something like
that.”</p>
<p>“Toby Smith, huh? Well, he can’t sell it because
I can’t turn it over to him. Only saw it in the Buddha’s
head, and in a man’s hand. Maybe Toby already has
it. Let’s go ask him.”</p>
<p>“Can’t waste time. What’s your best price?”</p>
<p>“Well——” Roger had an idea. “You leave your card
and I’ll get in touch with you.”</p>
<p>“I won’t go higher than ninety thousand. If that
suits, call up Clark, on Fifth Avenue, and say you
are ready to close. He will understand, and will arrange
everything. Good day.”</p>
<p>Brusquely, abruptly, the man left. Roger let him go.</p>
<p>But when the limousine had drawn away, Roger
marked down its license number, and within five
minutes, from the Bureau of Motor Vehicle Licenses
he had information.</p>
<p>That license plate on the limousine belonged to a
wealthy man, often mentioned in financial news.
Roger, from a book of “Who’s Who” learned more;
he was a collector, among other things.</p>
<p>But, Roger asked himself, was his wealth, position
and hobby any reason not to place his name among
those suspected, or at least connected with the Eye
of Om mystery?</p>
<p>And Toby. And Clark. They came uppermost again.</p>
<p>If only he could get the hidden clue in his list!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c35"><br>Chapter 34
<br>TRAGEDY STRIKES AGAIN</h2>
<p>Without consulting his list, because he did
not want to have it in sight any more than he wanted
its place in the files discovered, Roger used the “thinking
den” for just what its name implied.</p>
<p>“Claws on glass,” he reflected. “Click of a contact.
Voice of Doom upstairs from Balsa-wood speaker.
That’s what the click was for. The plug-in that made
the connection through the house-wiring from record
to speaker-unit. The Voice again on a record that
ought to have been blank?”</p>
<p>He went through his list, mentally, to get all fifteen
sounds clear in his brain again.</p>
<p>“The call of ‘Fire’ and paper rattle sounding like
flames,” he completed his silent inventory.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he told himself, “the last one links
up with the Voice of Doom on the record, and that
links up with the Voice out of the speaker upstairs.
And the click, as the plug-in was made is a link there
too. Then, again, the thump in the corner that made
me start the picture machine—that could have been
disconnecting the plug-in. Doctor Ryder had thought
it was going to be more, for he was with me and
cried out, ‘start the machine’ or something.”</p>
<p>The clicks that he had first misread as dripping
faucets in a washing-sink, that had turned out to be
the safe combination being manipulated by an expert,
he put out of mind as explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>“The claws on glass hooks up with the film that
showed the ghost-kangaroo,” he decided. “That can
be side-tracked. Now, that leaves the talk that named
Clark, after the Voice of Doom—all three times it
could have been the same record, of course—what is
left?”</p>
<p>He re-pictured his clues.</p>
<p>“The grind of moving rocks on the records. None
in real rocks. A thump on the record. How do they
tell me anything? The record was not really made in
Tibet. It was made in America. I seem to remember
that the Tibet voice was deeper than the one on the
record. But why did the record add something not
in Tibet? The rock rasp. Is that my real clue?”</p>
<p>Puzzling about it, and trying to see what link there
was between the thump and that additional grinding
sound, he got no inspiration.</p>
<p>His meditation was interrupted by the arrival of a
caller, a man from the Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>He wanted the laboratory to work out some extremely
complete system for protecting the museum’s
very valuable collections, such as the gem exhibit, and
other priceless collections.</p>
<p>Roger had to explain the absence of his cousin on
“business” and to accept the assignment conditionally
on Grover’s acceptance.</p>
<p>“Probably some short-wave system could be worked
out,” he said, and the caller left.</p>
<p>Grover telephoned. Told of the call, he agreed to
accept the commission and would call at the museum
before coming to the lab., when relieved by Potts toward
nightfall.</p>
<p>Roger went back to his broken thread of meditation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>An attempt had been made to get into his room.
Millman had been caught. His motive, he had said,
was to learn whether Roger played scientific tricks.
Did that ring true? Or, as Roger felt, could he have
wanted to silence a tongue able to accuse him about
Astrovox?</p>
<p>Roger tried to fit that theory in.</p>
<p>“It just won’t quite come,” he mused, despondently.
“But I must be considered fair game because I know
something. There is the man who thinks I have the
Eye. Having it wouldn’t make them want to get me
out of the way. Only the Tibetans would try that, and
<i>not until</i> I said where the Eye is hidden. And I don’t
know. Still, I have been attacked by some gas in the
dark-room. Now what <i>am</i> I supposed to know that
would reveal the ‘who’ in this?”</p>
<p>A shout from the upper floor broke his reflections.</p>
<p>With a sinking feeling in his stomach and with
heart skipping, he opened the private door and looked,
listening, toward the stairs.</p>
<p>Millman and Ellison, Hope and others, were
stampeding toward the steps.</p>
<p>“What was it?” he called.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ryder—something has happened——”</p>
<p>He joined the hurrying group.</p>
<p>In the partitioned room, among the cages and plant-housing,
on the floor, lay Doctor Ryder, with Toby
standing beside him, his face looking horrified.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Mr. Zendt came stamping up the
steps.</p>
<p>Ellison, bending in a crouch over the prone figure,
looked up.</p>
<p>“Did he faint?” he asked Toby sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>“N—no, sir. Just fell down that way.”</p>
<p>“Are you—sure?”</p>
<p>“Ye—yes-sir.”</p>
<p>Roger moved closer. “Is he—alive?”</p>
<p>“His pulse is very low, but he breathes. Now,”
Ellison stood up, organizing them dictatorially,
“Toby, bring ammonium—any form.”</p>
<p>It flicked through Roger’s subconscious mind that
the electrician knew chemicals. He had not used the
ordinary, every-day “ammonia” but then he had not
added the word to indicate the chemical nature of an
ammonia solution. It might be because he was
excited.</p>
<p>“Roger, have the stenographer call a doctor—or an
ambulance from police Headquarters is a quicker call.
Zendt, what do you say this is?—Stroke? Coma?” The
bio-chemist bent down, squatted.</p>
<p>“Did he stand in front of that Beta-ray?” he asked
Toby.</p>
<p>The helper, apparently very much frightened, perhaps
afraid of being accused of something, grasped at
this eagerly.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes-sir. He was right in front of it, working
on them new rats he got in. Why? Will that lamp burn
him?”</p>
<p>“Those rays may have a disintegrative effect, some
reaction in the human body. I can’t say. I saw it was
on, and asked.”</p>
<p>If that was a solution, there was tragedy, but not
a culprit—a careless accident, instead, Roger mused.</p>
<p>Was Toby’s word, he mused, having made the
stenographer contact the police—was Toby’s word to
be trusted. Or had he—what?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The ammonia, and chafing of wrists, had no beneficial
effect.</p>
<p>Almost immediately a police car came; and soon
afterward the interne from the ambulance was examining
the man who had been put on the laboratory’s
emergency cot.</p>
<p>The doctor bent close, sniffed at the faint breath.</p>
<p>“Get the stretcher,” he ordered abruptly.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Roger’s voice shook.</p>
<p>“Poison, I think.” He used their medicinal emetics
as a first-aid measure, but almost without waiting for
effects, took the inert figure away.</p>
<p>Mr. Zendt, standing reflective among the group of
stunned laboratory workers, suddenly confronted
Toby.</p>
<p>“Did he—drink anything?”</p>
<p>“Y—er——”</p>
<p>“<i>Did he?</i>”</p>
<p>“I—no—yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Water?”</p>
<p>“Y—yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Did he get it himself—where? What glass did he
use? A clean one?”</p>
<p>Under the fire of questions Roger saw Toby redden
and then whiten, heard him stammer and try to evade.</p>
<p>Out of it all came a sudden declaration.</p>
<p>“I never give him no poison. He told me to get him
a drink. I went to the cooler, and drawed water in the
glass. I knowed it was clean. I always get told about
washing everything the minute it’s done with, and I
did it even with the glass.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>If he had washed the glass, no evidence or clue to
its former contents would remain in it. Was that,
thought Roger, a way that a person might behave who
had put something in the water? Or was Toby, as he
insisted, innocent. But no one else had been there!
Or had Zendt, formerly up with the doctor, put anything
in that glass perhaps intended for either of the
pair working there?</p>
<p>It was a maze.</p>
<p>And out of the staff, two were impotent.</p>
<p>Roger shuddered. A thought turned him all goose-flesh.</p>
<p>Might some one else be the next?</p>
<p>Which of them?</p>
<p>Maybe he, himself, might be.</p>
<p>Or—he thought—was it all over? Was the real culprit
caught?</p>
<p>The police arrested Toby, took him away.</p>
<h2 id="c36"><br>Chapter 35
<br>THE STALKING TERROR</h2>
<p>Roger left the laboratory. He located
Grover. His recital amazed and stunned his cousin.</p>
<p>“Astrovox unconscious still. Ryder hovering in the
balance. Toby in a cell.” Grover summed up. “Two
attempts to reach you—and why? Can’t you think,
Roger?”</p>
<p>“I’ve mauled my brain, but I just don’t see what I
seem to be expected to know.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>“And the missing jewel,” groaned Grover. “Where
is it?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen it since Clark put it in his pocket,
in the temple, Grover.”</p>
<p>His cousin considered the matter as they took lunch
in a quiet corner of an uptown restaurant.</p>
<p>“You lock up securely and make certain that the
devices all work.” Grover said, as they separated, “I
shan’t have to stay with the old man, because it isn’t
expected that he will regain his wits for at least several
days. I must go to the museum. Business has to go on.
Then I will have a talk with Potts. We have given
him what the French call a ‘white card’—a clean slate.
But—I want to question him. He might have picked
up the real gem. He could have realized what a find
it was. He may not have discarded it. And while I
hate to suspect him—”</p>
<p>“But he wasn’t there, today, when Doctor Ryder—”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>Roger was silent. Like Grover he hated the idea;
but Potts had been free, supposedly resting. He might
have been around. If anybody could know ways to get
in—oh, it was not thinkable, though!</p>
<p>Much more Roger preferred to mistrust the electricians,
or the bio-chemist.</p>
<p>On his way back he stopped at home to get the
record carrying the “fire” and crackles. He would
need a fresh record for that night.</p>
<p>With his package he returned to the laboratory.
Everything was quiet, there. The men, in their activities,
were sober but busy. Zendt greeted Roger.</p>
<p>“How is Astrovox?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Roger told him. It was suspicious, the young cousin
decided, that Zendt was so anxious. Less so, it seemed,
about Doctor Ryder. He made no inquiry, though
Roger, coming in, had called up the hospital to learn
that the man was out of danger due to the prompt
action of the interne at the laboratory. He must be
quiet, for ten days or, at least, for a week, Roger had
been told.</p>
<p>“Astrovox,” he told Zendt, “is unable to say anything,
and they don’t expect anything else for days.”</p>
<p>That, he hoped, would “spike” any intentions the
man might have to harm the old astrologer. Not wishing
to say more he hurried to the dark-room, quickly
put the waiting films in a time-and-temperature regulated
bath and went out of the place for the eighteen
minutes that would elapse during development. He
busied himself clearing out the waiting requisitions
for minor needs from the stockroom, tested the glass
used by the doctor with no result, and then put the
films in hypo. for fifteen minutes, staying in the open
rooms during fixing period and washing afterward.
He was not going to be caught in that dark-room, with
Grover and Potts away and some stalking menace
quite possibly still abroad.</p>
<p>His list was still in the file, he made certain. He had
thought that it might have been taken; but he realized
that whatever was on the paper was also in his head,
and that was why he was endangered.</p>
<p>When it came close to closing time he helped clear
away used trays and other chemical apparatus,
washing-up. He gathered up all films and got ready
for the next day’s work. The developed and printed
film he left on the drying drums, not caring to stay
long in the dark-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>When, close to the office at all times, he was certain
that the staff was absolutely out of the building, he
began a careful and thorough, but hurried series of
operations.</p>
<p>His decision to stay there all night, discussed with
Grover, had finally been agreed to by his older cousin.</p>
<p>At home, there was no way to avert the trick used
before. The fuse box could not be guarded unless they
hired a Falcon patrolman.</p>
<p>That the laboratory was more impregnable had
been proved the night before by the effort used to
enter. The fire, set off probably by a pole carrying a
light, inserted from above the telescope, had been assurance
that even the skylight was considered too
risky by whoever had wanted to enter. That one had
set the fire, hoping that firemen would have broken in,
giving him—not her unless the stenographer was suspectable—a
chance to run in with them.</p>
<p>What <i>they</i> could want (or what <i>he</i> could want),
Roger did not seem able to decide. Not the laboratory’s
secrets. When the false gem had been sought in
the safe, nothing else had been disturbed.</p>
<p>Roger, determined to stay all night in the laboratory,
made his preparations with thoroughness and
care in spite of his speed.</p>
<p>The old microphones set at doors, windows and
other probable entrances, he tested. The cameras he
took out of circuit. They would not need to record,
because no one must get in to be snapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>From the upper room he resurrected the old
shadow-box with its panel of lights, connecting them
into circuits so that the least disturbance by any
microphone, even a vibration of its sensitive diaphragm
by slight sounds, would cut a relay and light
the right lamp.</p>
<p>The connections of the magnetic plates he traced,
to be sure no one had cut a cable. Where they all came
together at the transformer Roger transferred the connection
from the 180-volt step-up to the next higher
output. Anyone touching any plate must receive a
300-volt charge. He would not risk anyone getting
away, granting that such a one got past the bolts he
wired fast, as he did with window catches.</p>
<p>The fuse-box bothered him. If an intruder could
in any way get in and pull out fuses, perhaps all his
precautions to hold them would be futile.</p>
<p>Presently a solution of that difficulty came to his
trained mind.</p>
<p>With the fuses left in place, he disconnected the
cables that fed the protective devices, wearing heavy
rubber gloves and with rubbers on his feet.</p>
<p>Taking that set of flexible cables back behind the
furnace and to the main box of the electric company
input, he risked later censure for tampering with their
property by breaking their seal on the box, throwing
off the big, main switch, and connecting-in his cables
to the main line just within the input lines. He closed
the box, sealed it with the switch again in the “on”
blades, and knew that any outsider must be ignorant
of his precaution. The fuses could be pulled, the wires
at the switch-boxes could be cut, and still his plates
and microphones would be actively charged, potent
and effective.</p>
<p>Roger, effectively sealed in, he felt, sat down with
the supper he had ordered in, saving milk and sandwiches
for later, and ate with a feeling that he was safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Half way through the meal, with an inspiration, he
took a charged wire from the main-line up to the telescope
still poked up out of the skylight. He had
climbed up. If anyone started to climb down—what a
shock that telescope would give.</p>
<p>Contentedly he closed his meal with a big cream-puff.</p>
<p>Soon after that darkness came. Roger, unwilling to
discover his presence by lighting a light, sat comfortably
in Grover’s “thinking den,” and put his
thoughts to work on the problem of that list of sounds.</p>
<p>If he had only guessed it, his very elaborate precautions
had been overdone by just one protective effort.</p>
<p>Night chased the western glow away and brought
stars to look down upon a very quiet, apparently deserted
building.</p>
<p>Roger, restless after an hour of fruitless thinking,
wandered at slow pace toward the upper floor, planning
to start there on an inspection route that would
kill time and give new assurance.</p>
<p>He had not completely mounted the stairs when he
heard a sharp, almost explosive crackle. His eyes were
dazzled by a flash as if it had begun to storm and
lightning had flashed. He stood, transfixed. The flash
died, and to his amazement he heard a queer sound
as if splintered glass were dropping, tinkling and
scattering; and yet it was a muffled sort of clinking
noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>He summoned his best courage and with shaking
limbs crept on up to the second story. There, looking
around half-fearfully, he was more amazed than ever.
In the gloom, objects he knew well by location loomed
without any apparent change. The telescope pushed
its long barrel upward, the table and chairs, cabinets
and cages, seemed as before.</p>
<p>He threw on a switch for light.</p>
<p>None came!</p>
<p>He stood there, baffled. Had the power-house cut
off their “juice” or had a dynamo cut out for the time?
No. There had been that detonation and flash. A
torpedo such as he had made? No—more like the spark
from their high-tension transformer jumping a gap.</p>
<p>As he stood there, something below him went over
with a crash!</p>
<h2 id="c37"><br>Chapter 36
<br>A LAW OF NATURE</h2>
<p>Roger, in the dark, hearing the echoes of that
crash, felt fright that nearly swept him into unreasoning
panic.</p>
<p>Not quite, though!</p>
<p>With every effort of will he held his muscles steady
when he wanted to run. Clear faculties would be all
he had left to pit against an adversary certainly more
than simply vindictive. The unknown was almost as
brilliant in mind as was his cousin, Grover.</p>
<p>Grover? Why <i>he</i> would have thought out that one
and only way in.</p>
<p>Roger, forcing himself to be calm, realized at once
how his extra protection had been turned against him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>He had wired to the telescope. Some one, climbing
the candy factory fire escape, looking down from the
roof of that building, could, by the angle of view, have
seen him attach that wire, peering down past the bulk
of the telescope. Thus charged, all the miscreant had
to do was to lay a wire or rod or any metallic carrier,
from the candy factory drains or rainspouts across to
the skylight. By pushing it into contact with the heavy
charge in the telescope, a short-circuit could be established
that would blow even the main-line fuses.</p>
<p>Thus, and in no other way, could the devices have
been rendered impotent, the locks be only held by
wires which a powerful implement in hands so adroit
could easily sever.</p>
<p>Even the alarms would not work. They had undoubtedly
operated at the instant of the break, and
in time a Falcon patrol agent and anyone who called
police from home, would help him. But until then!——</p>
<p>He must, Roger knew, be his own protector.</p>
<p>At ten Grover would arrive, using a pre-arranged
signal.</p>
<p>Not for an hour would he come.</p>
<p>“Self-preservation is the first law of Nature,” Roger’s
mind in a whimsical flash reminded him. Instead of
throwing his faculties into a turmoil, the imminent
danger calmed him. That much Grover had made him
learn.</p>
<p>By opening a way in, the miscreant had, for Roger,
made clear a way out. He was, then, in no vital trap.</p>
<p>He could afford to drive back panic, to think carefully
what to do.</p>
<p>If the whole building had been short-circuited, the
telescope was no longer charged. He had climbed it.
Climb it he could again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>His problem, though, was to trap his unknown adversary
if he could.</p>
<p>With no electrical help he must think out a plan.</p>
<p>It must be clever, Roger knew. His menace was from
a man as brainy as was his cousin. And that, Roger
felt, was a compliment to a very unjustified person.</p>
<p>He thought he knew what the crash had been.
Something deliberately upset in the cellar, to scare
him. It had come about as long after the flash as would
have been consumed in rising to the roof on a rope,
scuttling down the fire escape, opening the cellar coal
chute, and climbing down.</p>
<p>He estimated the time that had since elapsed. The
adversary had by now gotten up the cellar stairway
and would be on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Would he come further or try to lure Roger down,
the solitary youth wondered.</p>
<p>He must let that become apparent by what his keen
ears would detect.</p>
<p>He discarded all but attentive listening, making his
mind focus on some plan to trap his adversary.</p>
<p>What his mind had, with seeming whimsicality,
obtruded during his moment of terror, came back to
Roger. “Law of Nature.” seemed to prod at his
thoughts. <i>What</i> law of Nature? How would it help?</p>
<p>Almost as though some inner monitor was going to
save him, a mental visualization of the laboratory
seemed to become clear to his mind. He saw the ceilings,
with the slim pipes that ran here and there to
openings; and he connected the vision with the fact
that their fire-protective apparatus had <i>not</i> functioned,
when the alarm had been set off. The tanks of
heavy gas, under pressure, were still charged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>“Gravity!” Roger’s mind grasped at an idea, “that’s
the Law of Nature I am trying to think up.”</p>
<p>As if he had received a key to a tantalizing problem,
Roger solved his course of procedure in a flash. In
his mind he ran over their stock of chemicals. Hydrocyanic
acid, a stinging, powerful combination of
cyanogen and hydrogen; and hydrochloric acid—and
many more.</p>
<p>One of these, akin to a tear gas, would do. But he
was cautious, and in spite of the pressing uncertainty
he paused to be sure he would not take for his plan
anything that could, in combination with the fire-smothering
gas, cause an explosion.</p>
<p>Almost at once he had the solution. Sulphuretted
hydrogen—the common, refined gas that comes in the
city mains from gas plants to stoves and gas jets—<i>that</i>
would not explode in combination with the heavy gas
in the compression-tank system!</p>
<p>He wanted a gas that would stupefy: but he needed
to be sure that it would lie, close to the floor.</p>
<p>The gas in the fire-prevention apparatus was such a
heavy gas that on being liberated, under pressure, it
would settle rapidly, diffusing and spreading, as if it
could be likened to a cloud, surcharged with moisture,
settled on the earth, enfolding it like a blanket.</p>
<p>There, in the upper room, was the means of releasing
the city gas, which, Roger knew, would stupefy
of its own constituents—even kill, in time. He did
not intend to give it that much time! He merely had
the desire to put his assailant into a state where he
could not leave.</p>
<p>Either the intruder was hesitating because of
Roger’s silence or he was very quiet in his actions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Roger, equally quiet, was extremely active. He had
unlaced and had slipped off his shoes at once. On
stocking feet he tiptoed to the large gas outlet set into
the wall for use with Bunsen burners or gas heaters
used in experiments where a regulated heat was
needed.</p>
<p>This he opened, full, by turning the valve one half
a revolution.</p>
<p>Darting swiftly away from its low, humming release
of a heavy flow, he ran quietly across to the thermostat
on the wall, connected into the fire alarm and release
system. Under it was a manual lever, one to be
operated by hand, in any emergency where the thermometer
failed.</p>
<p>Swiftly Roger threw this on, and with his handkerchief
tied over his nostrils and back of his head, for
already he smelled the gas of the opened outlets, he
swarmed up the telescope.</p>
<p>The house-lighting gas, he knew, would be held
down, running to the lower floor down the stairway,
and the amount released would be enough to stupefy
quite soon. Even if the adversary climbed the stairs,
he would be in a bath of the sleep-inducing sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>
<p>With his arms and legs helping him rise, Roger
clambered up the inclined metal barrel of the telescope.
At the top, above the flow of smother-gas to
kill fires, he paused, listening.</p>
<p>Not a sound.</p>
<p>To the roof he clambered, and sat on the coaming
of their skylight, looking down, waiting a few
moments in case the other tried to come up.</p>
<p>Below him all was silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h2 id="c38"><br>Chapter 37
<br>REVELATION!</h2>
<p>Soon Roger felt that he had given the gases
time to flow down, to produce at least inertia or coma.
He must not dally too long. He scrambled up the
rain-drain as he had previously done.</p>
<p>Down the front fire escape of the candy factory he
scuttled.</p>
<p>No one seemed to be near, as he gave a hasty survey.</p>
<p>Then Roger stiffened, on the lower stage of the
fire escape. On the other side of the street some one
emerged from a doorway.</p>
<p>Hearing the man walk rapidly across, Roger
dropped, landing in a crouch that broke his fall.</p>
<p>He meant to accost the person openly, and risk
consequences.</p>
<p>“Stop!” he shouted.</p>
<p>He got almost as great a shock as had come from
the flash of the short-circuited telescope.</p>
<p>“Rog’!”</p>
<p>“<i>Tip!</i>”</p>
<p>He recovered from his daze. A cold horror stole
over him.</p>
<p>Potts, their handy man, around there. And no one
else. Or—was another inside? More probably, smelling
gas, Potts had retreated the way he had come,
escaping.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Roger demanded.</p>
<p>“Watching. Grover bid me to.”</p>
<p>“Well, we will soon know. He’s due at ten.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Roger pretended he had something in his coat
pocket.</p>
<p>“You’re covered, Potiphar. Don’t try to escape.”</p>
<p>“Me?” in surprise. “Are you batty?”</p>
<p>“Somebody short-circuited the telescope after seeing
me wire to it, to be sure no one got in to attack me.
You’d know how to do that!”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>
<p>There would be a way to tell whether Potts was
aware of the gas.</p>
<p>“Easy to prove you’re innocent. Let’s go in and
search.”</p>
<p>Briefly, not entirely, he stated the case, omitting
the gas.</p>
<p>Potts drew back. “We ain’t—armed. I see through
your scheme, with your hand in that empty pocket.
Nix. I go in when we get a cop or somebody.”</p>
<p>He might know about the gas and that would account
for his lame excuse. It was not like Potiphar,
Roger thought, to shirk danger.</p>
<p>“All right. But I’ve got to get in and shut off that
gas.”</p>
<p>He had to let Potts go, just in case there was any
other inside the fume-filled lab. Roger, running to
the drug store, where an ex-service man was on duty
as he remembered, begged him to find an old gas-mask.
The man hunted through some things in a back
room, and gave Roger the proprietor’s old war trophy,
which Roger, with his aid, adjusted.</p>
<p>Thus protected, and aware that Tip still waited, he
ran in with no fear of setting off electrified alarms,
dashed up to the second floor by aid of a flashlamp
picked up in the office, seeing no one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The gas he shut off hurriedly and then he set the
thermostat lever back in case the tanks held more
unexpelled fumes.</p>
<p>Throwing wide all the windows on the ground
floor, he wished that they had current for the fans to
blow out more quickly the gases.</p>
<p>Potts, waiting, wanted to quarrel about Roger’s
suspicions; but Roger sent him to the drug store to
return the mask and call the lighting company, tell
the rough conditions and get an emergency squad in
to re-fuse and seal their input boxes.</p>
<p>Grover came along about the same time that the
truck finished and departed.</p>
<p>Quickly, on the sidewalk, Roger recounted the
situation.</p>
<p>With current on, in spite of the company’s annoyance
at this tampering with sealed boxes, Roger,
smelling less gas than would be dangerous in a
momentary invasion, set fans going and rushed out.</p>
<p>On the pavement they discussed conditions. Roger
could not help feeling that Potts was to blame, had
been, in spite of all loyalties, in face of past good
conduct—Potts had been his adversary.</p>
<p>“He was the one who put the record on my home
recorder, with the fire-call on it already.”</p>
<p>“How’d I know?” flared Potts, “I—it was with the
unused ones.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?” Roger threw back at him his former
grunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>“Tip could have substituted an exposed film for the
unused ones, so that we developed the animals. He
could have taken the film to the zoo and got the
kangaroo, maybe with an ape. We can check,” he
insisted. “He could have transferred the first culture
meant for the rats to the place behind Doctor Ryder’s
racks.”</p>
<p>“For that matter, Grover could of did any of them.
He could have as much cupola as me.”</p>
<p>“Cupola?” broke in Roger.</p>
<p>“He means ‘cupidity’,” remarked Grover, “thinking
about the Eye.”</p>
<p>“But <i>he</i> says he found it. Admits it. And Mr. Clark
vows he had blundered, and threw away the good
gem,” persisted Roger, sure of his incriminating clues.
“Who says the gem was left in India? Who had the
sense to pull fuses, to stop our devices? Who else
but somebody trained by you, Grover——”</p>
<p>“Well, <i>you</i> was trained, too,” cried Potts, angry.</p>
<p>“The gas is expelled by now,” Grover had not lost
his cold, serious expression. “There is desperate need
for action, more than for recrimination. Let’s go in.”</p>
<p>They sat in the office. Roger recounted the clever
warning with his watch charm on its big chain, given
by Doctor Ryder, and all the mystifying, or incriminating
conversations and occurrences, including a
fuller account of his experience in the dark-room.</p>
<p>“I suppose the poor mice are gassed,” he muttered,
finally.</p>
<p>But Grover was not listening.</p>
<p>“Tip,” he stood up, “help me push this desk aside.”</p>
<p>Potts did as bidden.</p>
<p>“No shot was fired in here,” Grover snapped.
“When Astrovox was later assaulted. What happened,
Roger? Don’t you know? And <i>you</i> exploded a torpedo
to call attention to a certain place and away from
some other?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Roger was all at sea for a moment.</p>
<p>“Astrovox was leaving. The other fellow didn’t
know that.” Grover had caught some clue or hint,
somewhere. He was as active, as alive, as if he had
never been a cold, precise, restrained scientist.</p>
<p>“Some one wanted us all to run here. As he produced
the summons, Astrovox ran in. The man
realized that he was recognized. Poor Astrovox! Well,
he will recover. And—see there!”</p>
<p>He pointed to a brown, scorched spot under the
far edge of the desk as it had been before.</p>
<p>“A foot, on an explosive, such as your torpedo,
Roger. Evidence out of sight. Evidently had no time,
later, to remove the burn, but did remove the exploded
detonating cap. Rubbed his shoe over it. See
the scorch? Test and you will get something like a
gunpowder reaction. Maybe you can scrape up dust
that would test out with the nitric acid to show the
stains of explosive gases.”</p>
<p>Of a sudden he straightened up.</p>
<p>“The acid test!”</p>
<p>Roger, and Potts, gaping, had no way of following
the swift deductions which the Mystery Wizard, on
the trail at last, made.</p>
<p>“Roger—no, Potts, you do it—run out and bring a
taxi. Roger, you go up and watch in the stock-room,
but keep out of range of any missile sent through
the skylight.”</p>
<p>He began writing as Tip rushed out and Roger
obeyed. On his way, as Potts came racing back, Roger
heard, “Go to that address. Bring every shoe you can
dig up. And get what’s written below, on your way
back.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>He locked the door after the man departed. Roger
heard the alarms being re-set. Then his older cousin
joined him.</p>
<p>“What told you?” Roger knew that the Mystery
Wizard was, at last, living up to his name.</p>
<p>“Claws-on-glass. Think. That was one big error.
You have told me the truth.”</p>
<p>Roger was baffled. He saw nothing that he had
said which linked up with the queer, sizzly, scrapey,
frying and clicking sound.</p>
<p>Grover, with the upper floor extension plugged in,
made call after call. “Grover Brown, calling Chief
of Police—hello—that you? Chief, we’re going to have
a round-up at the lab.” The usual calm was nil-minus.
“Will you?—Glad if you come with the men—I will
ask you not to let the men be seen—Wait at corners,
across the street—Watch the skylight of our roof for a
blue signal—Yes, then come in a hurry—Good-bye.”</p>
<p>To Roger’s stupefaction he repeated almost the
same instructions to the men from Tibet, adding,
“And—I promise to return to you the genuine Eye
of Om—Good-bye.”</p>
<p>“But what told you, Grover?”</p>
<p>Grover glanced at his wrist-watch.</p>
<p>“The one clue that no one else could furnish.”</p>
<p>He stood erect, alert, his eyes glinting.</p>
<p>“We’ve got work to do. Let’s get going!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<h2 id="c39"><br>Chapter 38
<br>THE VIGIL</h2>
<p>“Blue glow,” Roger gasped. “Are <i>you</i> going
to have fireworks too?”</p>
<p>“No. You will adjust the big sun-lamp so it sends
rays upward. Put the blue filter from the star-reader’s
plant beds on it. It is only fair that part of his equipment
should help catch and round up the one who
struck him.”</p>
<p>Roger, with nothing but thoughts to occupy him,
went to prepare the signal. He could hear Grover
making calls. To a police Bureau. To his staff men.
To Falcon’s patrol agency.</p>
<p>To Roger it appeared to be as dense a mystery as
ever; but to his brilliant cousin something had torn
aside the fog.</p>
<p>He tried to fathom that evasive clue. He went over
his ideas. Claws on glass? No! Then what, besides?
Something he should recognize in the light of what
he knew. Something that the miscreant had imagined
him bright enough to have guessed, perhaps.</p>
<p>It escaped him, eluded his every attempt to read
that riddle.</p>
<p>Only a short time was he allowed to concentrate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>There were hookups to be made. A chair in the
store-room was to be wired down two legs, positive
and negative wiring, a plate of metal as thin as possible
was to be found and put on the seat, with small
clamps to hold it in place under a thin covering cloth.
It was to be left where it stood, but two wires must
be taken from a wall outlet, led to small, flat disks
like microphone diaphragms, tacked onto the floor
at a place Grover designated.</p>
<p>With that done and the wires fixed in a plug-in to
fit the outlet, Roger left the circuit disconnected as
ordered, and busied himself leading wires from the
sun-lamp, with its blue cover-glass, to the stock-room
shelves where they must be so set that a can of film,
shifted and dropped over them by hand, would complete
the circuit, act as a switch to light up the sun-lamp.</p>
<p>Grover came up, inspected, and pronounced the
work well done.</p>
<p>“Now, get a nitric acid test-bath ready, in a big
container—and have some wax melted and ready for
the test for exploded gases.”</p>
<p>“Whose hands did we overlook?”</p>
<p>“No hands. Feet.” Grover answered, alertly, and
with a smile—mystery-solving seemed to transform
him from a staid, self-contained scientist into an eager,
boyish experimenter.</p>
<p>“Shoes?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“His?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Then—whose?”</p>
<p>“If you are too dull to have read your own sound
clues, Ear Detective, far be it from me to dull your
wits by telling. Think!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Presently Millman, Zendt, Ellison, Hope and several
other staff men, in pairs or alone, arrived. They
were eager, excited as they questioned. Grover, picking
Roger’s list of clues out of his file, presented it
and suggested that what he had learned they could
learn, while Roger recounted his own experiences up
to date.</p>
<p>That was done; and they pored over his list. Grover,
getting a lot of amusement out of their guesses,
chuckled to himself; but his younger cousin felt that
he was watching them to see when the guilty one
would crack and admit that he was cornered.</p>
<p>Who, besides, could be guilty? Doctor Ryder was
in hospital; so was Astrovox. So, in jail, Toby Smith
was out of the night’s excitement.</p>
<p>To his amazement, a police car, arriving, brought
an officer who brought in the last captive he had been
thinking about—Toby.</p>
<p>The men seemed to have found no light in Roger’s
list.</p>
<p>Roger, who had heard their sane, or wild surmises,
suddenly sat up.</p>
<p>Some brain cell, stimulated by the continual stress
of cogitation, spoke its concealed message.</p>
<p>“I know—Grover—how dumb I’ve been.”</p>
<p>He scribbled a name on a slip from the office desk.</p>
<p>Grover nodded.</p>
<p>“You should have seen—heard the right answer long
ago.”</p>
<p>“I left it for the Mystery Wizard, so he could keep
up his reputation,” grinned Roger.</p>
<p>The Tibetans walked past, identifying their presence,
but went on down the street. Grover, watchful,
looking out of the window, made a signal that he had
noticed them, and then suggested that they all go up
to the stock room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>There, in the silence, with no light except that in
the monitor-panel which Roger had set up to show
which entrance was used when they could expect
callers, they sat around, puzzling and trying to make
Grover speak, although any one of them could have
been suspicious of any other, the way they talked. A
light announced the arrival of a visitor, but Grover
did not move. Potts, he knew, was coming; and his
inference was the right one.</p>
<p>Potts, with a bagful of shoes, came in and dropped
his find beside Grover’s chair.</p>
<p>“Take this chair, old fellow,” Grover was very
grave and had an air of trying to make up to his handy
man for Roger’s mistrust; but Roger knew that the
chair moved over so casually had been most carefully
set on two small disks, not charged yet—but how easily
so made active agents for trapping the sitter!</p>
<p>“Now we must be patient,” Grover stated, arranging
the nitric-acid bath, paraffin heater and other apparatus
on a table. “I shall test some shoes, presently,
and I expect them to verify my judgment. In the dark,
though, I shall give the miscreant one chance to secure
his Eye of Om before I denounce him.”</p>
<p>Someone, in the dark, shifted his feet, Roger
imagined, uneasily.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean to say you left it there!” It was
Toby who made the gasping admission in his sudden
excitement.</p>
<p><i>He</i> knew it was there!</p>
<p>“Still where, for all your seeming denseness, you
worked out its place,” agreed Grover. “If you care to,
you might apologize to Roger for telling the millionaire
collector that <i>he</i> had it. Of course it was to
avert all suspicion from yourself.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>“Aw—”</p>
<p>He did not have time to complete his denial or
blustering cry.</p>
<p>A light in the tell-tale went out. The main door
was opening.</p>
<p>“Nervy,” commented Grover.</p>
<p>A strange, heavy thudding, or thumping, accompanied
by something as much like the drag of a heavy
rope as any other sound, told Roger that some weird
development was coming. Could it be—really, a
kangaroo?</p>
<p>And why, then, was there a strange chattering and
jumping sound?</p>
<p>What would they see?</p>
<p>Those sounds grew louder. The stairway shook.
Low growls or words of command sounded.</p>
<p>Some animal, approaching. Or animals! No man—Roger
was sure.</p>
<h2 id="c40"><br>Chapter 39
<br>THE APE AND THE KANGAROO</h2>
<p>Whatever was in the laboratory, it was
coming straight up to the second floor. Roger,
crouched beside the floor outlet to await a signal to
plug in and electrify that chair, wondered why Grover
did not move the film can, make contact and light the
signal lamp to summon the police and the Tibetans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Instead, Grover spoke, low and meaningly.</p>
<p>“The first man who gets up is the guilty one!”</p>
<p>Zendt, who had started to rise, sank back abruptly.
Ellison and Millman stayed as they were, half bent
forward.</p>
<p>“Guilty nothing!” Toby spoke in a rasping voice.
“Think I’ll sit here and let something attack me?”</p>
<p>“You heard me,” snapped Grover.</p>
<p>Roger knew that it would be a question of seconds
only; and they would then see the approaching creature.</p>
<p>There in the dark it was a tense moment, and a
nerve racking one.</p>
<p>Louder, thudding on the floor, with a strange dragging
sound at the end of each pause, came the approach.</p>
<p>“Roger—that bag.”</p>
<p>“The shoes, Grover?” in dismay. What was the
matter with Grover?</p>
<p>“Quickly. That bag.”</p>
<p>Roger lifted it, and Grover, snatching it, opened
the paper sack, dragged out a bulky object, just discernible
in the dim light they had from the tell-tale
panel.</p>
<p>Roger gasped.</p>
<p>“Boxing gloves!”</p>
<p>“Lights!” snapped Grover; and as Potts, lifting an
arm, snapped on the wall switch just above the place
his chair occupied, Roger saw his cousin pulling on
the padded mitten-like objects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Whether the rest knew or not, that told Roger what
to expect, if not the whole situation. A kangaroo. A
boxing kangaroo. The one he had photographed
when he had questioned its attendant who had said
no pet or trained animal had left the stable.</p>
<p>In the next room something stopped, and there
came, not loudly, a low command.</p>
<p>There was an interval of suspense. What, Roger
wondered, was the condition in that partitioned place
adjoining their waiting room?</p>
<p>After a momentary wait, and more seemingly guttural
commands, the thumping was resumed; and
the animal, in short hops, came to the entrance door.</p>
<p>There it paused as if dazzled or surprised at the
light or by the crowd.</p>
<p>Behind it, in the other, darker room, shown by
their own light, Roger saw a hairy, man-like creature,
either chimpanzee or some other large mammal it
seemed to be. The kangaroo’s keeper, he assumed.</p>
<p>Just as in the under-exposed film, where the ghostly
ape and its Australian companion had seemed to
dance, the kangaroo hopped in, while the ape, grimacing
and beating its chest, danced in behind it.</p>
<p>Straight at Grover leaped the kangaroo. It wore
boxing gloves!</p>
<p>Roger, crouched, tense and frightened, saw his
cousin, with a typical boxer’s stance, prepare to carry
the coming battle to his astonishingly expert antagonist.</p>
<p>In that room, while the company shrank back,
against walls, pushing their chairs out in front of them,
leaving a clear space, the animal and the man closed
in as fast and as bizarre a contest as Roger had ever
viewed. Not clumsily, but with lightning-quick jabs
of its short forearms the beast lunged, taking blows
without a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Grover, clever through gym training, fast on his
feet, evaded the fairly clumsy leaps and lunges. At
every chance he got in a blow.</p>
<p>If, as Roger inferred, the ape was indeed the trainer,
the bulky creature bore out the idea. Grover had to
watch the skipping, leaping hairy thing that tried to
get around and catch him; and also, as far as Roger
could discern his cousin’s tactics, Grover seemed to
be so handling his leaps and side-wise ducking that
the ape would be mostly near to Potts who sat, tense,
but still, in that chair; and Roger, crouched by the
wall outlet, wondered if he, the handy man, meant
to take part and if Grover had foreseen it.</p>
<p>“No you don’t!” Grover seemed to be talking to
the kangaroo, but of course it was the ape he really
meant to have hear, Roger knew.</p>
<p>“You keep far from the cabinet. What if it is ...
och—oh! Missed me, old fellow ... even if it is unlocked.”</p>
<p>As though telling a story as he dodged and ducked,
Grover always talked as he maneuvered, his breath
well conserved by his ease of action.</p>
<p>“So there <i>was</i> a scientific student who turned to
jewel theft! ... he did want to get rich quickly ... he
was clever ... made a specialty of locating ... prized
gems.... Through a jeweler named Clark, he ... he
got into contact with those ... who would pay well ...
got the gems ... used the jewelry place as a clearing
house....”</p>
<p>In that fashion he began outlining a solution.</p>
<p>“Heard of the Eye of Om, didn’t he?... Went to
Tibet, taking Toby ... didn’t dare make a stab for
it, though....”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Grover jumped back so that the monkey missed
grabbing him.</p>
<p>“Got through Clark a man ... who would pay
fabulous price for that Eye. And ... worked out plan
to have it so cleverly stolen <i>for him</i> that he would
never be suspected by Tibetans or other gem
thieves ... oh, you would, eh?...” as the ape made a
lunge and Roger, avoiding it, had to drop to his
haunches to avoid the boxing kangaroo’s leap and
stroke, “Would, eh?... try to get to that cabinet....
Like to paw the Eye of the Buddha, eh, would you?”
as the ape started to take a part by coming up to grasp
him from behind. Roger was about to shout, but he
saw that Grover, like an eel, slipped aside. He did
not strike at the ape.</p>
<p>“The gem robber knew he would be suspected if
he ... took the Eye ... returned to America ... made
an elaborate plan ... would use science ... chose our
lab....”</p>
<p>Grover, his cousin saw, as did the rest, kept
maneuvering so as to keep the lunging paws approaching
as he backed around. For some unseen purpose
he seemed to be manipulating his actions so that he
could get the ape and the kangaroo into some desired
relationship or position.</p>
<p>Roger, still at his place, not daring to desert his
post, saw the ape back toward Potts.</p>
<p>Instantly, as though by some previous order, Potts
snapped his body out of the chair, and with his arms,
catching the thing that walked upright like a man
around its torso, he dragged its shaggy body backward
off the huge feet and flung it into the chair.</p>
<p>“Plug in!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Still dancing backward from the leaping kangaroo,
Grover shouted. Roger, checking the tremble and
shake of his excited hands, swiftly drove home the
prepared plug and at the same instant from the thus
electrified chair rose a sheer animal howl of pain and
fright and fury.</p>
<p>Still alert, Grover had a moment to catch his breath.</p>
<p>As if startled, the kangaroo paused. On haunches,
its forepaws were hanging down over its pouch—it
was a female with the pouch to carry its young!—while
from the chair came the most ferocious grunts
and screeches. The trainer, thought Roger, was an
actor in spite of his surprise. He maintained the
animal voice well.</p>
<p>As if prepared for the situation, Potts dragged from
a pocket some light, strong electric wire, and with
gloves of rubber which Roger had seen him getting
ready, he managed to get the wire around the beast,
or rather, as Roger put it to himself, the man in the
animal hide.</p>
<p>“You can cut the plug out, now, Roger.”</p>
<p>Grover, with a wary eye on the still quiet kangaroo,
which had not moved, spoke the command. Roger
obeyed.</p>
<p>Released from the shocking cycles of current, the
thing in the chair growled and struggled against the
bonds which Potts had cleverly wound to prevent use
of arms or legs. So powerful, though, was the beast,
that it once upset the chair and had to be righted,
growling and using guttural imprecations or shouts of
hatred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>“To go on with my story,” Grover calmly confronted
the quiet kangaroo, “the man chose our laboratory
as the base of his plans. He came here. To start
his operations, he watched his chance one night, and
hid in our large refrigerating unit, that is in the spare-stores
room, since we used it to test chilling processes
for food shipments.</p>
<p>“Being unsuspected, he had been able to make certain
preparations. First, he put the culture intended
to inoculate some white rats, into our chemical section,
half-hidden, but purposely left where it could
throw suspicion on a certain person. Then, when the
rats had been inoculated, but with a harmless drug
that made them sleep, he was ready for his next step.”</p>
<p>To Roger’s surprise, everyone had been so amazed
and so startled by this calm recital aimed, apparently,
at a dumb brute that sat back with drooping, glove-shrouded
forepaws and listened!—or was too baffled by
the capture of the trainer to continue the battle—the
staff had settled in the chairs again.</p>
<p>“This mysterious, clever criminal,” Grover coolly
proceeded to tell the animal his theories and deductions.
“This former student of various biological,
chemical and related subjects, bribed an animal
trainer who had a vaudeville animal act, to let the
animal used in the act come here. He wanted it to be
caught if any plan failed, so he could disappear but
the animal could not tell on him.”</p>
<p>He bent forward, and quietly removed the laced
ham-like gloves from the beast’s relaxed paws, and it
seemed not to resent the act, but let the free forearms
hang loosely across its stomach, and pouch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>“Borrowing the white rats from the act, this miscreant
prevented them from being inoculated by exchanging
labels on the culture, later recovering the
labels as the bottles emptied were thrown to the fire.
The labels, on the real culture again, were put where
they would seem to clear someone by incriminating
him through circumstantial position in the racks.
Really, though, they had a different purpose.”</p>
<p>He startled all but Roger.</p>
<p>“The appearance was that the man whose rack they
occupied was being persecuted. In reality, he did it
himself, to make me suspect every other staff man.”</p>
<p>“Not Doctor Ryder!” Millman gasped.</p>
<p>“You have named the culprit.”</p>
<p>“But he’s poisoned, in the hospital——”</p>
<p>Grover went right on, ignoring Ellison’s shout.</p>
<p>“He confused us by ‘stealing’ the rats, and in other
ways, because he wanted us to think of every possibility
but the real one.”</p>
<p>“And that was?——” prompted Hope.</p>
<p>“He wanted us to help him take a false imitation
of the Eye of Om to a Tibetan temple, replace it for
the true one, which he could then sell for a great
sum. In other words, what we thought we were doing,
helping restore the true jewel, was exactly the reverse!</p>
<p>“We innocently helped remove the True Eye of
Om!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2 id="c41"><br>Chapter 40
<br>THE MYSTERY WIZARD’S SOLUTION</h2>
<p>While the beast shackled in the chair kept
up its hoarse growls and struggles, Grover outlined,
for the benefit—it seemed—of a kangaroo—or the one
in the chair—his deductions.</p>
<p>“Was that clever? You know it was. To plan to steal
a sacred gem under the pretext of replacing a fake
one with the true Eye.”</p>
<p>Roger had not guessed that, nor, by the exclamations,
had the rest of the group—or most of them.</p>
<p>“The mystery of the white rats, supposed to be
deadly menaces because we thought they were inoculated
with germs of a spinal malady, got our attention
turned to every possible idea but the real one.</p>
<p>“To add to our consternation, give a ghostly touch
with the animal ‘spooks’ on a film, this clever thief
made a record of what he recalled about the Tibetan
Buddha’s ‘Voice of Doom.’ Like most criminals, he
overshot his mark, adding the grind of rocks, when
in truth there was no such grind. The sound was
caused by wind, always howling across the Himalayas,
coming through a wind-tunnel cut in rock from the
base of a cliff to the lamasery temple on its crest.</p>
<p>“He made a record, with moans, cries and groans,
and added the effect of the rock closing, from his
imagination of what would be right.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>That record he had managed to slip onto their own
recorder-reproducer machine, with a hookup which
Roger knew all about, Grover went on. The weird
manifestation had startled them, while watching for
the man, one night. With a Balsa-wood speaker hidden
flat on a dusty shelf, he had caused a spooky voice
to draw them up where the prepared film, in a can
carefully re-sealed, was handy to be taken and, later,
developed, to complicate mysteries further with the
spooky animals, he added.</p>
<p>“That was all for the reason that he had to bring
in Tibet, logically,” went on Grover, “he had to prepare
us for the fact that he was in danger from the
Tibetan vengeance. Of course, by this time, the staff
knows, as we do, who I refer to.”</p>
<p>Of course, Roger decided. The others nodded. Who,
but the guilty man he accused, could be meant? He
had said the man was menaced.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ryder was the only one who claimed he
was threatened,” said Millman, “and I suspected
Roger of playing jokes!”</p>
<p>“Well, I suspected you when you came to my room,”
retorted the youthful listener.</p>
<p>“And I did not know whom to suspect,” Grover
took up his story. “Clues pointed this way and that.
Appearances are easily falsified and I tried to dig past
them to truth—only, I lacked the right hint, and never
dreamed that a gem was to be stolen under the pretext
of restoring it! That was easily planned, for once the
gem had been seen, perhaps photographed with a
watch-camera or some small photographic device, a
man like Clark, working with him for a share of the
profit from various gem sales, could reproduce in
imitation the green jewel.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>Toby, he inferred—and the youth eagerly attested
the truth of the inference—had been paid well, being
a former helper at the Clark store on Fifth Avenue,
but out of work—had been paid to sell the supposedly
“real” Eye, its facsimile, for an absurd amount, as
he had accepted a movie camera.</p>
<p>“I fell into the lure,” Grover hurried along, “because,
for a time, the Tibetan Voice of Doom manifestation,
and the robbery of our safe, confused me.
It was easy to do that last by de-fusing our cellar
switch-boxes, a point I had never thought of. Scientists,
like criminals—or average people—trip up often
enough on some minor point in a plan.”</p>
<p>Because the radio would allow him to be in touch,
and for the sake of the travel, adventure and scientific
aid Roger would get and give, his older cousin confessed
that he had been glad to see Roger help the
supposed replacement of a sacred relic.</p>
<p>“Clark was brought in cleverly by use of a record.
It was the same one that had been used for the Voice
here, and when the needle was dropped onto the unused
part, it made a thump that was one of the sounds
of a series of clues which puzzled Roger and me, because
the <i>appearance</i> was that it was all one recording.</p>
<p>“The trip to Tibet went off as scheduled. Roger,
really a sort of ‘bait’ because of his youth, was, as
hoped, taken up to the lamasery as a sort of curiosity—a
young American well up in scientific methods and
operations. Innocently he played the thief’s plans, and
still the very apparatus that he insisted on taking
there made the lamas suspicious, especially one of their
wiser men who had been out of their country, who
understood English, and who had read Roger’s
memoranda of radio talks to and from lamasery and
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>“With Tibetan vindictiveness, they let him hear
the Voice of Doom, probably operated by a concealed
priest in the hollow image, and then consigned him,
and Potts, to the tunnel. By sheer wit and scientific
knowledge Roger found that he was in a sort of
whistling tube, operated when the rock door was
opened, by wind. He worked out, with Tip’s wise
help, the secret, and they escaped.</p>
<p>“Clark, when Roger got to camp, took the supposed
Eye and with Roger watching and unsuspicious,
actually replaced the true Eye with the false one he
and Ryder had brought along. He had another, and
to make Roger think he was genuinely through with
the stone, so as to be clear if any Tibetan revenge developed,
he threw away one more imitation. Potts,
worried about the levers having been wedged which
he considered an error of judgment, went back to
repair it.”</p>
<p>So interested were the men in following the developing
solution that they had forgotten how bizarre
was this relation of a mystery and its unveiling—to a
beast.</p>
<p>The animal seemed fascinated, or cowed, or subdued
in some way. Perhaps, thought Roger, the plight
of the hidden keeper made it tame.</p>
<p>Grover drew his theories into shape.</p>
<p>“Naturally, with the real gem, Clark and Ryder
made all speed to radio the prepared airplane. It met
them. In Bombay, as he had no desire to be further
involved, Potts discarded the false gem he had picked
up.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Then, proceeding on pure deduction, Grover felt
that the Tibetans had discovered their real loss, had
discerned that Roger and Tip had solved the intricate
tunnel secret and had escaped. To write, with Roger’s
discarded note book as a guide, in a semblance of his
writing, was easy. The letter had come by fast mail
steamers and had further confused him.</p>
<p>“Then the thief, with the gem in his fellow-worker’s
possession, encountered difficulties,” went on Grover;
“the man who had been intending to buy the jewel
probably became frightened, afraid of the danger
that the stone might bring around him. So many
priceless jewels carry curses, or bring disaster, that
he must have gotten ‘cold feet’ and a new buyer had
to be sought. The gem, also, had to be secured, in case
the Tibetans actually put into action their vengeful
methods.</p>
<p>“Toby was working here. Ryder thought it a clever
plan to have this former aide help him, and so he
concealed the gem and had it innocently delivered
here, but Toby, not as dumb as he was considered,
suspected the truth, discovered the hidden gem, and
on his own hook offered to sell it to a buyer he had
known at Clark’s store.</p>
<p>“That made it necessary for Ryder to recover the
gem quickly from the concealment no longer unsuspected
here. He tried to get people away from upstairs,
by detonating with his foot a torpedo under
our office desk; but Astrovox, our scientific star-student,
had been about to go home, frightened by
some foolish combination of star-positions and a
manifestation planned to scare him away. He walked
in before Ryder could hide, recognized him—and the
desperate man struck him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>“Soon thereafter he realized that in a list of some
fifteen sounds made by Roger there lay the actual
clue that incriminated him and no one else!”</p>
<p>“What was it?” asked Ellison anxiously or eagerly,
Roger told himself.</p>
<p>“What Roger thought was claws-on-glass. His very
first sound-clue. With that on a list, and in the clever
head of the stock-room clerk, Ryder had two things
to do quickly. He must get the gem, and he must
either find a way to throw suspicion elsewhere or get
Roger out of the way.”</p>
<p>Roger realized why many attempts had been made,
like the one in the dark-room.</p>
<p>“I warned Roger. Ryder, when Toby—who knew
where the gem was—telephoned him that he had left
explosives out in the open—Ryder tried to use that
as a way to lure Roger here to open up, because we
had so arranged things that actually no one could
even enter and not be caught—he was deadly afraid
of being electrocuted too soon.</p>
<p>“But Roger is still safe, the gem is available, and
so—as you well know, there is no more mystery, except
this:</p>
<p>“How do you think you are going to get the Eye
of Om—now?”</p>
<p>Roger stared at his cousin. Saying that. To a beast!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<h2 id="c42"><br>Chapter 41
<br>MAN AND BEAST</h2>
<p>With his mocking smile Grover walked
over to their safety cabinets, unlocked and threw one
wide open.</p>
<p>Roger, with Potts, sidled over near the door, to
block the beast if it had been taught to snatch anything
in its paws and hop away.</p>
<p>“No need,” Grover laughed, “with its partner,
the ape, bound. There is no way to get out of that
hide.” He gestured toward the cabinet. “There it is,
just as you hid it, the True Eye, in a can supposed to
contain medicating compounds to use on the rats.
Clever, just as was entry into Roger’s room, with the
‘Fire’ record, by that often-used idea of the pulled
fuse. I have wondered why you did nothing to him.
Or did Millman come along too soon and scare you
off?”</p>
<p>He paused, and they all stared. Could Grover have
miscalculated, Roger wondered, in implying that the
kangaroo was the impersonator? He had assumed it
was the ape.</p>
<p>The beast, on its haunches and flatly extended tail,
reached two clawed paws upward, caught one of the
round cans from the front row, and dropping it in the
loose pouch, in the skin, turned and started hopping
toward the door, its claws upraised.</p>
<p>Grover, as it moved toward the chair occupied by
the ape, deftly caught its tail and swung an end around
a chair leg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>“Shall I turn on the current?” he chuckled.</p>
<p>The animal became quiet, stopped.</p>
<p>Once only he tried to escape and when Potts made
a move to obstruct the way Grover calmly waved him
back.</p>
<p>“But he’s got the can, Grover!” Roger also stepped
forward.</p>
<p>Grover actually grinned at them.</p>
<p>“Let him go,” Grover waved back Potts and Roger
as the thing began to hop toward them and they made
preparations to try to stop it.</p>
<p>“The Doctor,” went on Grover as the animal paused
an instant, “to get Toby where his word would not
be trusted, to remove him from the laboratory before
he could take away the gem he knew about, planned
his own poisoning this morning. He sent Toby for
a drink, and by swallowing some quick-acting sedative,
perhaps strong codein, or another of the poppy
derivatives, he seemed to be poisoned. To make it
appear like strychnine or some other—wait! I’ll venture
to assert that in the other room Roger will find
the shell of some pit such as you crack in a peach and
extract a tiny kernel. Those inner kernels of a peach
pit, chewed up, would leave on his breath just the
same odor as a very dangerous poison which I shan’t
name.”</p>
<p>Later that was verified. Roger found the cracked
peach pit.</p>
<p>“It was easy to ‘recover’ and come here tonight,”
Grover ended.</p>
<p>He stood, looking with a mocking smile at the
crouched beast and the bound animal. The latter,
quiet for a moment, growled deeply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>“The ape, trained at a certain point, to unfasten
the kangaroo-skin so that Doctor Ryder can wriggle
out of it, can’t help,” he remarked. “Oh, yes,” to
Millman’s question, “the ape is genuine, a well
trained animal. The kangaroo—shall we help him?”</p>
<p>He walked over, and with a quick motion pointing
out the laced arrangement of eyelets under an armpit—or
forepaw—he dragged the lacing apart.</p>
<p>Revealed, it was seen by all that Doctor Ryder
actually was in the skin, crouched down as the size
of the animal compelled him to be so that he could
barely get his forearms into the front paws.</p>
<p>The head, too small to hold his own cranium, was
fixed almost in one position by supports, and eye-holes
were cut lower in the skin, well concealed by
the way the skin of the chest was sewed and the
animal hair arranged.</p>
<p>“He rented it from the animal trainer, who sometimes
put it on, and played the part of his own animal
in the act if the kangaroo became too fractious or
when it was ill in our varied climate as they travelled
from theatre to theatre.”</p>
<p>Cramped, scowling, Doctor Ryder emerged.</p>
<p>“Very cleverly worked out,” he growled. “Yes, it
is all true. I did plan to have your laboratory staff
help me steal the Eye, just the way you have it worked
out. And if it had not been for Roger, almost at the
beginning thinking of developing a sound-film I had
neglected to put out of commission, you might not
have found out.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>“Probably we never would,” Grover agreed, and
as bluecoats came tramping up the stairs, with a man
who went at once to his animal, and with soothing
words quieted it, released and removed it, the Tibetan
lama and his cohorts came in.</p>
<p>“But what <i>was</i> the sound-clue?” asked Millman,
“the fire-cry on a record supposed to be unused? I
got that, you know. But it meant only a prank of
Roger’s to me.”</p>
<p>“Neither that, which revealed how the Balsa-wood
was connected up, nor the Voice of Doom, made by
Ryder, here, but not traceable to him alone; nor the
click as he switched on the motor; nor the clicks as
his trained thief’s fingers manipulated our safe; nor
the rest.”</p>
<p>“Well, what <i>did</i> the sound that Roger described as
claws on glass really signify that linked up Ryder and
not any of us?” asked Zendt.</p>
<p>The pseudo-physician, scowling, was twirling his
watch-charm with nervous fingers as he watched the
Tibetans who scowled at him.</p>
<p>“He is showing you,” Grover remarked.</p>
<p>“Don’t you see?” Roger turned to Millman. “I got
the right idea only just tonight.”</p>
<p>“The watch-chain? But——”</p>
<p>“You, Mr. Millman, and Mr. Ellison, were on the
ground floor when the man came down because he had
seen the rich man arrive in his car, and knew Toby
had played false to him,” Grover stated.</p>
<p>“Think,” Roger hinted, “he twitched and twirled
that charm so it flicked light from the gold, the way a
heliograph does.”</p>
<p>“That, when Roger told me, connected him with
the first sound-clue of the scratching, hissing, clicking
sound at first claimed to be a snake, then supposed to
be his kangaroo.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>“Don’t you see,” interposed Tip, who was improving,
by leaving out the big words, “he had to bend over
to get the rats out of the trap on top of the cage.
He brought the ape to unlace his disguise. And his
watch chain and charm scraped and rattled and slid
on the cage, and our sound-camera film got the sound
from the microphone inside the cage.”</p>
<p>“Of course—and no one else wears a chain and
charm,” agreed Zendt, “we all have wrist-watches.”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s the use of holding me for all this?”
growled the man by the skin. He picked it up.</p>
<p>“I’ll just return this—go on and arrest me if you
have any charge you can support with evidence that
a clever lawyer can’t break down,” snarled the man.</p>
<p>“A sound record, through your own Balsa-wood
device, and down to our recorder, will do the trick,”
Grover smiled. “Made by you, just now, when you
admitted all my previously recorded accusations.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’m licked. Good night, all.”</p>
<p>He turned as if to give himself up to a policeman.</p>
<p>“He’s got the Eye, in with that compound!” cried
Roger, as Toby pointed at the pouch in the Kangaroo
skin.</p>
<p>“Oh, no he hasn’t,” Grover actually chuckled in
triumph, “in the same way that he substituted the prepared
can of film for a blank strip when he handed
Roger the can to load the magazine—so his animal
ghosts would seem to appear on an unexposed film
when developed, I substituted a can of oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen and a trace of ozone, perhaps, and a few
other gases——”</p>
<p>“Air?” gasped Ryder, shaking the can taken from
the skin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>“A free sample of air that is no longer contaminated
by the gas Roger so cleverly used to drive you out—a
ruse that enabled me to get here before you could
return in disguise.”</p>
<p>The man was defeated.</p>
<p>He was allowed to remain only long enough to make
Grover’s triumph complete by sending Roger to the
cabinet to take down the can just behind the place
from which he had removed his false one.</p>
<p>Therefrom, the Tibetans were glad to receive, as
they forgot all animosity toward Roger, the true Eye
of Om.</p>
<p>For his attempts on Roger’s safety and his act toward
Astrovox, Ryder stayed behind bars a long time.</p>
<h2 id="c43"><br>Chapter 42
<br>CLOSING TIME</h2>
<p>The Ear Detective, more favored than ever
because he had been the means of listing sound-clues,
one of which had completely linked Ryder into his
crime, was busy.</p>
<p>Astrovox, well recovered from his blow on the
temple, was going to “shoot” the stars as they crossed
over the lens of his telescope and Roger was getting
a sound-film into a camera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>“Why in the world did Ryder have to go to all that
trouble?” the old star-reader inquired. “How much
simpler to have come in his own clothes. More freedom
for his hands, that way, and no need to bring the
ape to unlace his animal skin.”</p>
<p>“He knew,” Roger explained, “about out protective
device, and by wearing the skin and bringing the dancing
ape, he would never be photographed and he
would fool us all the more.”</p>
<p>“Well,” remarked Astrovox, “you’ll remember
that Neptune—the planet of deception—was opposed
by Saturn, the planet of obstruction, and there was
an opposition of Mars, ruling explosives, with Uranus,
which is, you might say, the planet that brings up the
unexpected.”</p>
<p>Roger smiled to himself.</p>
<p>Good old Astrovox, he mused, with his oppositions
and “aspects” and all, was, still, a very clever scientist,
and must be humored.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he chuckled, “and if I remember all you told
me, something like this was in the ‘horoscope’ that day.
The ‘sixth house’ has to do with animals—smaller
animals, and Neptune with larger ones.”</p>
<p>“That is my astrological teaching.”</p>
<p>“Well, Neptune is in that sixth house, and if Saturn
is the planet of obstruction it shows why the false
doctor in his deceptive disguises, would be obstructed
or caught.”</p>
<p>“Rats!” Tip snapped.</p>
<p>“Rats are under the sixth house,” Astrovox seriously
persisted in apparently preposterous ideas, “and
Neptune showed how the gas was used and also how
the acid test, when Grover applied it to the shoes
Ryder had worn, revealed in the paraffin cast the exploded
gas of the torpedo he had stepped on to attract
attention just when I ran in and recognized him.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>“What explains <i>my</i> denseness?” Grover arrived,
with a special quartz lens for some prism-and-spectroscope
color work, “I was put off the track at first
because Ryder knew my favorite axiom, ‘dig past appearances
that can be falsified, to find truth which is
ever the same.’ He deliberately hid the culture tubes
in his own racks, and I fell into his trap, trusting him,
thinking he was being victimized by some one else. It
made it possible for him to be here, operate the trick
with the Voice of Doom and hand Roger the prepared
film supposed to be unexposed, carrying his animal
pictures that he took at a special performance given
him for good pay by the animal trainer.”</p>
<p>“Your density was because Mercury was in the
twelfth house, and squared the moon in the third—wrong
deductions.”</p>
<p>“Maybe those ‘houses’ are true,” chuckled Grover,
“I know one house <i>I</i> am going to occupy. My own
home. For a good sleep. How about you, Roger?”</p>
<p>“After I see that all our apparatus is fixed for the
night.”</p>
<p>“You go ahead,” Potts grinned fondly at his chum,
all suspicions forgiven, “I’ll see that everything er—uh—coagulates!”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
